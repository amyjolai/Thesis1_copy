abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is a (in principle exact) theory of electronic structure, based on the electron density distribution n(r), instead of the many-electron wave function $\Psi$(r1,r2,r3,...). Having been widely used for over 30 years by physicists working on the electronic structure of solids, surfaces, defects, etc., it has more recently also become popular with theoretical and computational chemists. The present article is directed at the chemical community. It aims to convey the basic concepts and breadth of applications:  the current status and trends of approximation methods (local density and generalized gradient approximations, hybrid methods) and the new light which DFT has been shedding on important concepts like electronegativity, hardness, and chemical reactivity index.},

abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from the high-NO x photooxidation of isoprene was dissolved in water and irradiated with l {\textgreater} 290 nm radiation to simulate direct photolytic processing of organics in atmospheric water droplets. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize the composition at four time intervals (0, 1, 2, and 4 h). Photolysis resulted in the decomposition of high molecular weight (MW) oligomers, reducing the average length of organics by 2 carbon units. The average molecular composition changed significantly after irradiation (C 12 H 19 O 9 N 0.08 + hn -C 10 H 16 O 8 N 0.40). Approximately 65{\%} by count of SOA molecules decomposed during photolysis, accompanied by the formation of new products. An average of 30{\%} of the organic mass was modified after 4 h of direct photolysis. In contrast, only a small fraction of the mass (o2{\%}), belonging primarily to organic nitrates, decomposed in the absence of irradiation by hydrolysis. Furthermore, the concentration of aromatic compounds increased significantly during photolysis. Approximately 10{\%} (lower limit) of photodegraded compounds and 50{\%} (upper limit) of the photoproducts contain nitrogen. Organic nitrates and multifunctional oligomers were identified as compounds degraded by photolysis. Low-MW 0N (compounds with 0 nitrogen atoms in their structure) and 2N compounds were the dominant photoproducts. Fragmentation experiments using tandem mass spectrometry (MS n , n = 2-3) indicate that the 2N products are likely heterocyclic/aromatic and are tentatively identified as furoxans. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, these 2N heterocyclic compounds are produced by reactions between photochemically-formed aqueous NO x species and SOA organics.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose (NC) aerogel was prepared by sol-gel synthetic approach and supercritical carbon dioxide drying method as a new energetic matrix for nano-composite energetic materials. Scanning electron microscopy of the NC aerogel reveals that the aerogel is accumulated by nanoparticles with a diameter of 30-50 nm and has nano-porous structure, which makes the thermal behavior of the NC aerogel different from that of the NC fibers. Therefore, the thermal properties of NC aerogel were determined by TG/DSC, which showed that the maximum decomposition temperature and the exothermic peak temperature of NC aerogel decreased 8.2 and 11.4 degrees C than NC fibers, respectively. By TG/FTIR technology combined FTIR test of the condensed phase, the decomposition mechanism was derived based on the experimental results. The initial reaction of NC aerogel decomposition is the splitting of urethane bond, and then, the scission of -O-NO2 bonds happens. Moreover, the macromolecular chains' scission site of NC aerogel firstly occurs at -C-O-C- in the ring, while the chains of NC fibers break at -C-O-C- between the rings.},

abstract = {Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). The ab initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) {\textless} SN2 (X = F) {\textless} SN2 (X = Cl) syn-E2 (X = F) {\textless} anti-E2 (X = Cl) {\textless} syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F− + CH3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl− + CH3CH2Cl, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway.

The results corroborate the previous studies that levoglucosan (LG) is unlikely the essential intermediate to produce LGO. The most feasible LGO formation pathways from both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose include sequential 1,2-dehydration, six-membered hydrogen transfer and enol-keto tautomerization steps. Enol-keto tautomerization is the rate-determining steps for both reactions to form LGO.},

abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

We demonstrate how the synergistic activity of cellulases was enhanced by altering the hydrogen bond network within crystalline cellulose fibrils. We provide a molecular-scale explanation of these phenomena through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enzymatic assays. Ammonia transformed the naturally occurring crystalline allomorph I$\beta$ to IIII, which led to a decrease in the number of cellulose intrasheet hydrogen bonds and an increase in the number of intersheet hydrogen bonds. This rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within cellulose IIII, which increased the number of solvent-exposed glucan chain hydrogen bonds with water by 50{\%}, was accompanied by enhanced saccharification rates by up to 5-fold (closest to amorphous cellulose) and 60-70{\%} lower maximum surface-bound cellulase capacity.

@article{Foltz2009,
abstract = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a relatively sensitive explosive used in many electroexplosive devices as well as in medicine. Of primary interest to LLNL is its use in items such as exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators and exploding bridge foil initiators (EFI). In these devices the crystalline powder is pressed into a granular, low-density compact that can be initiated by an exploding wire or foil. The long-term stability of this pressed compact is of interest to weapon stockpile lifetime prediction studies. Key points about potential aging mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1) There are a number of factors that can contribute to PETN instability. These include particle size, polymorphic phase transitions, crystal structure, impurities, moisture, occlusions, chemical incompatibility and biological (microorganism) action. of these factors the most important for long-term aging of high surface area powders used in detonators appears to be that of particle size growth. (2) There is a great deal of literature on the thermal degradation kinetics of PETN, unfortunately much of it with little bearing on ambient temperature aging during long-term storage. PETN is very stable with respect to thermal decomposition. Low-temperature thermal studies have not revealed evidence of chemical degradation products in archived PETN. Data extrapolated to 30 C predicts a half-life of 12 million years. (3) Moisture seems to lower the activation energy for and accelerate the decomposition of PETN. (4) External drivers affecting stability include temperature, moisture, radiation fields, and stress, while internal drivers include residual solvents, and impurities. Temperature affects kinetic processes of crystal growth such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion rates of molecules on the surface of PETN crystals. A low-level radiation field may induce unexpected changes in the chemical makeup of PETN and its homologue impurities. Stress at high pressure points caused by crystalline surface irregularities may cause a decrease in surface area over time due to smoothing of contact points and sintering. PETN has been found to contain a number of impurities, including homologues, pentaerythryl ethers with a mixture of hydroxyl and nitrate functional groups, and organic salts, that can alter its physical and chemical properties. (5) The processes of sublimation/recrystallization and surface diffusion are important processes that can cause changes in PETN crystal morphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area. Sublimation feeds a process called Ostwald ripening, which involves the spontaneous growth of larger crystals from those of smaller size. This process proceeds with age regardless of storage conditions unless the crystals are treated to retard growth. The coarsening mechanisms include Ostwald ripening, 'sintering', and surface diffusion. The latter has not been experimentally observed, but a molecular modeling approach has attempted to investigate this phenomenon theoretically. (6) Threshold test fire, particle size distribution, specific surface area, thermal analysis, chemical analysis, powder compact specific surface area and density are approaches that have been used in the attempt to assess changes attributable to aging of PETN, with varying results. The biggest problem lies in the aging mechanism itself, which likely influences small changes in morphology, both internal and external, and particle size distribution changes on a scale too small to reliably monitor. Other aspects, such as subtle changes in density profiles within pressed powder compacts, may be beyond the capability of current technology to assess. Crystal growth significant enough to affect the PETN particle size distribution is expected to impact detonator performance. (7) Factors relevant to stabilizing particle size growth include crystal morphology, powder surface area and particle size distribution; crystal density and internal defects; and powder compact density and density gradients.},

However, the few papers that focused on the determination of nitrocellulose used in explosives employed analytical techniques [e.g., vibrational techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy), MS and ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and liquid chromatography (LC) (high-performance LC and ion chromatography)]. Most of the information reported by these techniques has been qualitative.

However, adjacent sugar rings alternate in conformation giving the chain a cellobiosyl repeat. The chains organize in sheets packed in a "parallel-up" fashion. The positions of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding were determined from a Fourier-difference analysis using neutron diffraction data collected from hydrogenated and deuterated samples. The differences between the structure and hydrogen-bonding reported here for cellulose I(alpha) and previously for cellulose I(beta) provide potential explanations for the solid-state conversion of I(alpha) --{\textgreater} I(beta) and for the occurrence of two crystal phases in naturally occurring cellulose.},

@article{Chin2007,
abstract = {Nitrocellulose based (NC) and nitroglycerin based (NG) propellants often have a fixed acid and water content during the manufacturing time. After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a a complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a it complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters. Correlation between heat flow curve, stabilizer depletion and free-radical distribution has been evaluated. An intramolecular decomposition mechanism is preferred, because it prevents the possibility that the NOx from NNODPA or NNDPA may interact with the NC and NG again during the rearrangement process. Since the acidity of the propellant composition continues to change during the aging process, multiple mechanisms may proceed simultaneously.},

abstract = {Potential energy surfaces, minimum energy reaction paths, minima, transition states, reaction barriers, and conical intersections for the most important atmospheric reactions of methyl nitrate (CH3ONO2) and methylperoxy nitrite (CH3OONO) on the electronic ground state have been studied (i) with the second-order multiconfigurational perturbation theory (CASPT2) by computation of numerical energy gradients for stationary points and (ii) with the density functional theory (DFT). The proposed mechanism explains the conversion of unreactive alkyl peroxy radicals into alkoxy radicals:? CH3O2 + NO ? CH3OONO ? CH3O + NO2 ? CH3ONO2. Additionally, several discrepancies found in the comparison of the results obtained from the two employed approaches are analyzed. CASPT2 predicts that all dissociation reactions into radicals occur without an extra exit energy barrier. In contrast, DFT finds transition states for the dissociations of cis- and trans-methylperoxy nitrite into CH3O + NO2. Furthermore, multiconfigurational methods [CASPT2 and complete active space SCF (CAS-SCF)] predict the isomerization of CH3ONO2 to CH3OONO to occur in a two-step mechanism:? (i) CH3ONO2 ? CH3O + NO2; and (ii) CH3O + NO2 ? CH3OONO. The reason for this has to do with the coupling of the ground electronic state with the first excited state. Therefore, it is demonstrated that DFT methods based on single determinantal wave functions give an incorrect picture of the aforementioned reaction mechanisms.},

abstract = {Data on the thermal stability of energetic materials such as nitrocellulose was required in order to obtain safety information for handling, storage and use. In the present study, the thermal stability of four nitrocellulose samples containing various amount of nitrate groups was determined by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetery-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the nitrocellulose occurs in the temperature ranges of 192-209 degrees C. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of compounds indicates that nitrate content of nitrocellulose could has affect on its thermal stability and its decomposition temperature decrease by increasing its nitrogen percent. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C/min) on the DSC behaviour of the nitrocellulose was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperature of the compound was increased. Also, the kinetic parameters such as activation energy and frequency factor for the compound was obtained from the DSC data by non-isothermal methods proposed by ASTM E696 and Ozawa.},

abstract = {Abstract. Organic nitrate chemistry is the primary control over the lifetime of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in rural and remote continental locations. As NOx emissions decrease, organic nitrate chemistry becomes increasingly important to urban air quality. However, the lifetime of individual organic nitrates and the reactions that lead to their production and removal remain relatively poorly constrained, causing organic nitrates to be poorly represented by models. Guided by recent laboratory and field studies, we developed a detailed gas phase chemical mechanism representing most of the important individual organic nitrates. We use this mechanism within the WRF-Chem model to describe the role of organic nitrates in nitrogen oxide chemistry and in comparisons to observations. We find the daytime lifetime of total organic nitrates with respect to all loss mechanisms to be 2.6h in the model. This is consistent with analyses of observations at a rural site in central Alabama during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in summer 2013. The lifetime of the first-generation organic nitrates is {\~{}}2h versus the 3.2h lifetime of secondary nitrates produced by oxidation of the first-generation nitrates. The different generations are subject to different losses, with dry deposition to the surface dominant loss process for the second-generation organic nitrates, and chemical loss dominant for the first-generation organic nitrates. Removal by hydrolysis is found to be responsible for the loss of {\~{}}30{\%} of the total organic nitrate pool.},

abstract = {The thermal and kinetic aspects of gas phase decomposition reactions can be extremely complex due to a large number of parameters, a variety of possible intermediates, and an overlap in thermal decomposition traces. The experimental determination of the activation energies is particularly difficult when several possible reaction pathways coexist in the thermal decomposition. Ab initio calculations intended to provide an interpretation of the experiment are often of little help if they produce only the activation barriers and ignore the kinetics of the decomposition process. To overcome this ambiguity, a theoretical study of a complete picture of gas phase thermo-decomposition, including reaction energies, activation barriers, and reaction rates, is illustrated with the example of the $\beta$-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) molecule by means of quantum-chemical calculations.

Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3 \rightarrow C6 \rightarrow C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

abstract = {A modified conjugate gradient algorithm for geometry optimization is outlined for use with ab initio MO methods. Since the computation time for analytical energy gradients is approximately the same as for the energy, the optimization algorithm evaluates and utilizes the gradients each time the energy is computed. The second derivative matrix, rather than its inverse, is updated employing the gradients. At each step, a one‐dimensional minimization using a quartic polynomial is carried out, followed by an n‐dimensional search using the second derivative matrix. By suitably controlling the number of negative eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix, the algorithm can also be used to locate transition structures. Representative timing data for optimizations of equilibrium geometries and transition structures are reported for ab initio SCF-MO calculations.},

abstract = {Testing of the commonly used hybrid density functional B3LYP with the 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d,p), and 6-31+G(d,p) basis sets has been carried out for 622 neutral, closed-shell organic compounds containing the elements C, H, N, and O. The focus is comparison of computed and experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition, the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the 622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation are 3.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 kcal/mol for B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction. A diverse set of 34 isomerizations highlights specific issues of general interest, such as performance on differences in steric effects, conjugation, and bonding. The corresponding MAEs for the isomerizations are 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol. Improvement is obtained for isomerizations of amines and alcohols when bot...},

abstract = {An adaptation of the chemiluminescence techniques developed to measure NO and NO2 in air is described. This adaptation has made it possible to make real-time measurements on the decomposition of nitrocellulose (NC) and PBX 9404 at realistic storage temperatures for these materials. Measurements are reported from 295 to 420degreeK. NOx (= NO + NO2) evolution in NC decomposition occurs with a k(T) of (1.9 ÷× 2) × 107exp [(−12800 ± 300)T] s−1 below 350degreeK, while above 370degreeK k(T) = (4.3 ÷× 4) × 1017exp [(−21500 ± 750)T] s−1, both per submole (molecular weight 264) NC. Prior T ≥ 370degreeK exposure of NC leads to increased evolution rates at ≤ 350degreeK because of the desorption of the NOx, which was adsorbed at the higher temperature. NO2 is shown to be the primary NC decomposition product and is rapidly reduced to NO. PBX 9404 results are compared to NC results and it is shown that diphenylamine, present in PBX 9404, catalyzes NC decomposition and also reduced NO2 to NO.},

abstract = {The energetics of the gas-phase SN2 reactions Y- + CH3X- \rightarrow CH3Y + X- (where X,Y ) F,Cl,Br), were studied using (variants on) the recent W1 and W2 ab initio computational thermochemistry methods. These calculations involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of up to spdfgh quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and contributions of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic effects, and (where relevant) first-order spin-orbit coupling. Our computational predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental data where these have small error bars; in a number of other instances reexamination of the experimental data may be in order. Our computed benchmark data (including cases for which experimental data are unavailable altogether) are used to assess the quality of a number of compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2 theory, G3 theory, and CBS-QB3, as well as a variety of density functional theory methods. Upon applying some modifications to the level of theory used for the reference geometry (adding diffuse functions, replacing B3LYP by the very recently proposed mPW1K functional [Lynch, B. J.; Fast, P. L.; Harris, M.; Truhlar, D. G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 4811]), the compound methods appear to perform well. Only the “half-and-half” functionals BH{\&}HLYP and mPWH{\&}HPW91, and the empirical mPW1K functional, consistently find all required stationary points; the other functionals fail to find a transition state in the F/Br case. BH{\&}HLYP and mPWH{\&}HPW91 somewhat overcorrect for the tendency of B3LYP (and, to a somewhat lesser extent, mPW1PW91) to underestimate barrier heights. The Becke97 and Becke97-1 functionals perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study, while the HCTH and HCTH-120 functionals both appear to underestimate central barriers. HCTH underestimates complexation energies; this problem is resolved in HCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the functionals considered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound thermochemistry methods. mPW1K, however, appears to be very suitable for generating reference geometries for more elaborate thermochemical methods in kinetics applications.},

But it is important to observe, 1 \degree that, in a great number of cases, the elimination is not able to be effected in any manner; 2 \degree that the resulting equation is generally very complicated, even though the given equations are rather simple. For these two motives, one imagines that it would be very useful to understand a general method which may be able to serve to resolve directly a system of simultaneous equations. Such is that which I have obtained, and of which I am going to say some words here.

abstract = {Activation energies for nitrocellulose (NC) degradation have been determined from Arrhenius plots constructed using first-order rate constants measured at 40, 50 and 60degreeC. The rate constants were obtained by monitoring the absorbance (A) at a wavelength in the visible region of an anthraquinone dye dispersed in NC thin films. The dye acts as a stabilizer and is slowly depleted as a result of its reaction with NOx from the breakdown of the nitrate ester groups on NC. The data produced two linear regions in the first-order plots of ln(A0/At) vs aging time. The first-region is attributed to the reaction of the dye with NOx desorbed from the NC surface. The activation energy (\~73.5kJmol−1) is in line with that found for NOx surface desorption processes. The second linear region is thought to be due to the reaction of NOx from the breakdown of the nitrate ester groups on the NC molecule. The activation energy (104.0kJmol−1) is consistent with that for nitrate ester hydrolysis. The use of UV-visible spectroscopy has in this way made it possible to monitor the degradation of NC non-destructively without the need for stabilizer extraction and analysis.},

abstract = {2-Ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) and nitrocellulose (NC) are commonly used energetic materials that have caused many thermal runaway reactions and explosions worldwide, and their thermal stabilities have always been an important issue. Based on the results of Roduit et al. (2013), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used in this study to investigate the thermal history's influence on the thermal stabilities of EHN and NC at different heating rates. The decomposition kinetics of EHN and NC were determined by the Friedman isoconversional method. The kinetic parameters with heat balance were analysed and used for the simulation of the adiabatic behavior time to the maximum rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRad). The results indicated that the thermal history significantly influenced the dynamic DSC curves, decomposition kinetics and thermal stability of NC, which decomposes autocatalytically. The influence was negligible on EHN, whose decomposition proceeds according to the “nth order” law.},

OBJECTIVE: Develop a composite propellant which has an extended plateau region in its burning rate vs. pressure relationship curve, as well as minimized variation in ballistic performance as a function of temperature change. DESCRIPTION: Double base (nitrocellulose {\&} nitroglycerine based) propellants widely used in Navy aircraft ejection seat systems experience degradation and depletion of the stabilizers used in the formulation over time with exposure to high operational and storage temperatures. This degradation results in safety risks due to the possibility of inadvertent spontaneous deflagration of the propellant. Current composite propellants typically do not have a pronounced plateau in their burning rate vs. pressure curves, and have a wider variation in performance with changes in temperature as compared to double base propellants. An innovative composite propellant to replace the current double based propellants used must be nitrate ester free and thermally stable across an operating temperature range from -65 degrees F to +200 degrees F. Ideally the propellant burning rate in the plateau region at ambient temperature would be approximately 1.0 inches per second at 2000 pounds per square inch (psi), followed by a negative slope in the burning rate curve, extending through at least 4500 to 5000 psi, and dropping by at least 0.4 inches per second. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Sigma sub p) would ideally be sp = 0.1 {\%}/ K or less. Such a composite propellant would have performance characteristics similar to a plateau burning double base propellant, currently in use in Naval ejection seat systems, but without the limited life inherent in propellants containing nitrate esters. This formulation would be developed and validated through adjustments to the propellant composition, followed by burning rate testing to demonstrate the effects of adjustments made. The burning rates of the final formulation supplied to the Navy will be measured at -65F, ambient temperature, and +200F across the pressure range of 500 to 5000 PSI. The formulation must contain ingredients which have been tested to demonstrate compatibility with each other. Mechanical properties testing, as well as basic propellant safety and characterization tests in accordance with NAVSEAINST 8020.5C are to be conducted, so a Department of Defense Interim Hazard Classification can be obtained for the propellant. The tests would be conducted on zero-time and propellant samples aged for 64 days at 200F, and the results supplied to the Navy. PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of the composite propellant developed in accordance with the identified parameters. PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate through testing, a formulation which meets the performance objectives for burning rate and temperature sensitivity across the pressure range on zero-time and aged propellant samples. Characterization tests, scale up of the propellant manufacturing process, and manufacture of a quantity of propellant samples, one to two kilograms, for delivery to the Navy would also be performed in Phase II. PHASE III: Conduct the complete propellant characterization testing per NAVSEAINST 8020.5C and manufacture and transition a quantity of propellant samples for delivery to the Navy for testing. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: A composite propellant developed under this effort could be used in commercial mining, blasting, oil and gas exploration cartridge applications where consistent performance is required across a wide variation in temperature.

abstract = {Different DFT methods give relative energies for models of the FeMo cluster in nitrogenase that differ by up to 600 kJ mol −1 . This is 4-30 times more than what is observed for other systems and explain why previous computational studies have given conflicting results. It is caused by differences in the oxidation state of the metals and the number of Fe-C, Fe-S and Fe-H bonds, connected to the amount of static correlation. Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can cleave the triple bond in N 2 , making nitrogen avaiable for other organisms. It contains a complicated MoFe 7 S 9 C(homocitrate) cluster in its active site. Many computational studies with density-functional theory (DFT) of the nitrogenase enzyme have been presented, but they do not show any consensus - they do not even agree where the first four protons should be added, forming the central intermediate E 4 . We show that the prime reason for this is that different DFT methods give relative energies that differ by almost 600 kJ mol −1 for different protonation states. This is 4-30 times more than what is observed for other systems. The reason for this is that in some structures, the hydrogens bind to sulfide or carbide ions as protons, whereas in other structures they bind to the metals as hydride ions, changing the oxidation state of the metals, as well as the Fe-C, Fe-S and Fe-Fe distances. The energies correlate with the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange in the method, indicating a variation in the amount of static correlation in the structures. It is currently unclear which DFT method gives the best results for nitrogenase. We show that non-hybrid DFT functionals and TPSSh give the most accurate structures of the resting active site, whereas B3LYP and PBE0 give the best H 2 dissociation energies. However, no DFT method indicates that a structure of E 4 with two bridging hydride ions is lowest in energy, as spectroscopic experiments indicate.},

abstract = {Well-characterized, purified samples of glycidyl azide polymer (MW \simeq 700) having one, two, or three terminal -OH groups were flash pyrolyzed (dT/dt = 800 K/s) to 540-600 K under 2 atm Ar by T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy. This technique emphasizes condensed-phase pyrolysis chemistry as opposed to gas-phase flame chemistry. The volatile products identified from the condensed phase were CH4, HCN, CO, C2H4, NH3, CH2O, CH2CO, H2O, and GAP oligomers. IR-inactive N2 is, of course, also present. The low MW products result from homolysis of the heavy atom bonds and H-atom migration, as opposed to heavy atom recombination reactions. After N2 release, the relations between the mole fractions of the products and the parent GAP structure were determined. The NH3 content increases with the -OH content, which suggests that NH3 is mostly formed by the end-chain azide groups. The hydrocarbon mole fractions correlate with the structure of the parent sample of GAP. CO appears to form from both the parent polymer and secondary sources, such as CH2O and CH2CO, at higher temperature. The HCN/NH3 ratio increases with increasing temperature. By using the product mole fractions and heat of formation of GAP, the calculated heat of decomposition (\simeq−1.4 kcal/g) is found to be three times larger than that measured by DSC (\simeq−0.43 kcal/g). The large $\Delta$Hd helps explain the reported high surface temperature. The relatively low reported flame temperature during combustion reflects the limited number of secondary exothermic reactions that are possible among the products. If it occurs during combustion, the apparent release of some GAP oligomers observed during flash pyrolysis would raise the flame temperature by allowing the decomposition of some of the GAP in the gas phase. The kinetics of formation of NH3 [Ea = 49 kcal/mol, In(A/s) = 42] were determined below the autothermal stage. Above the autothermal stage, the products form at too rapid a rate to be measured by the methods used.},

abstract = {A non-destructive UV-Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO-NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV-Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time' plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 degreeC, 50 degreeC, 60 degreeC and 70 degreeC gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO-NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO-NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO-NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO-NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 {\textgreater} C2 {\textgreater} C3.},

@article{Hu2011,
abstract = {Abstract. The presence of alcohol, organonitrate, and organosulfate species related to the gaseous precursor isoprene in ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has stimulated investigations of the nature of SOA-phase chemical processing. Recent work has suggested that certain isoprene-derived organonitrates are able to efficiently convert to organosulfates and alcohols on ambient SOA. In order to better understand the structure activity relationships previously observed for the isoprene-derived organonitrates and organosulfates, the hydrolysis reactions of a number of monofunctional and difunctional organonitrates and organosulfates with varying carbon substitution properties were investigated. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to study the bulk phase aqueous reactions of these organonitrates and organosulfates in order to determine hydrolysis reaction rate and, in some cases, thermodynamics information. Electronic structure calculations were also carried out to determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for these species, and for the previously studied isoprene-derived species. The results suggest that while organonitrates and organosulfates are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the corresponding alcohols at standard state, only the tertiary organonitrates (and perhaps some tertiary organosulfates) are able to efficiently hydrolyze on SOA timescales and acidities.},

@article{Ho2016,
abstract = {We recently showed for a large data set of pKas and reduction potentials that free energies calculated directly within the SMD continuum model compares very well with corresponding thermodynamic cycle calculations in both aqueous and organic solvents [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015, 17, 2859]. In this paper, we significantly expand the scope of our study to examine the suitability of this approach for calculating general solution phase kinetics and thermodynamics, in conjunction with several commonly used solvation models (SMD-M062X, SMD-HF, CPCM-UAKS, and CPCM-UAHF) for a broad range of systems. This includes cluster-continuum schemes for pKa calculations as well as various neutral, radical, and ionic reactions such as enolization, cycloaddition, hydrogen and chlorine atom transfer, and SN2 and E2 reactions. On the basis of this benchmarking study, we conclude that the accuracies of both approaches are generally very similar—the mean errors for Gibbs free energy changes of neutral and ionic reactions are a...},

The only clearly established point is the occurrence of reactions other than simple fission to alcohol and nitric acid, and the general view was that such side-reactions, including the formation of nitrite, arise from subsequent oxidation of the alcohol by the nitric acid. A more recent study, by Lucas and Hammett2, of the solvolysis of tert.-butyl nitrate revealed the concomitant formation of isobutene, while with benzyl nitrate, benzaldehyde and nitrite are also formed.},

@techreport{Buelow2002,
abstract = {This effort was a survey of the compatibility of a broad series of representative energetic materials (EM) commonly used in propellants, munitions and explosives with a proposed process of controlled decomposition in water near or above the critical temperature (approximately 373 degreeC). Central issues, in order of consideration, are safety, environmental compatibility of decomposition products, destruction efficiency, extrapolation to compounded formulations of EM, and engineering considerations for scale-up to full-scale operation. The sequence followed in these investigations was (1) initial safety evaluation and small-scale stability tests on each of 13 individual energetic ingredients commonly (all passed this stage); (2) determination of global kinetics and Destruction and Removal Efficiencies (DREs) (destruction was complete - all DREs are limited by sensitivity of detection); (3) identification of products and byproducts of the process to verify environmental compatibility (all tested passed this criterion); and (4) detailed reaction kinetics determinations and development of computational models (qualitatively successful application to nitromethane). An important result was the development of safe and practical means to deliver water-insoluble energetic materials (EM) into the supercritical region These methods included: 1) slurried particles, 2) dissolution in an organic solvent or supercritical carbon dioxide, and 3) digestion in aqueous alkali. A pilot- scale continuous pipe reactor suitable for handling slurried, dissolved, or hydrolyzed explosives was built and tested. Results show that supercritical water is a favorable medium for decomposition of waste and off-spec EM. The process appears to be controllable, and the decomposition products are contained until they are consciously released. Oxides of nitrogen do not form in significant amounts, presumably because the medium supports their decomposition at lower temperatures than does incineration. Digestion in aqueous alkali is a safe and economical pretreatment for most EM. Nickel alloy reactors can be used for formulations that contain only carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. Lined reactors are required for chlorine-containing mixtures and, in general, may be best of long term operation for all EM formulations. Useful detailed kinetic, fluid dynamic, and process modeling for SCW systems is not yet practical. Chemical reaction rates and physical properties data are needed for organic/ inorganic/water mixtures at high temperatures and pressures before models can quantitatively predict reactor operation.},
