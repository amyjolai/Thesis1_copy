\section{Electronic structure methods}
%Intro to the history spiel. What it is, where did it come from. 
%Wave particle duality. 
% Dodgy first sentence, change it. 
Electronic structure methods apply the principles of quantum mechanics to the evaluation of electron position and movement, thereby allowing chemists to derive the properties and interactions of molecules. 
Despite the long history of research and use of \ac{NC} in industry, experimental analysis has failed to distinguish the fine mechanistic details of its decomposition. This is partly owed to the variation arising from biodiverse \ac{NC} source materials, combined with the complexity due to the interplay of many different %myriad
and simultaneous degradation interactions. Electronic structure methods provide a means to %avenue for exploration/ opportunity 
untangle the individual facets of decomposition. %and study each in . 

At the most fundamental level, the wave function ($\Psi$) holds the description of a quantum system. %Need a linking sentence here - What is the wave function, and why do we need to look at the probablility densiy instead?
In a non-relativistic system, % So what happens in a relativistic system?
the probability of a particle possessing a given momentum, or residing in a particular location, is given by the probability density. This can be obtained by  multiplication of $\Psi$ with its complex conjugate,  $|\Psi^{2}|$. %Born interpretation. Ref? 
%Make sure you know what a complex conjugate is.
Integration of $|\Psi^{2}|$ over a region of space returns the probability that a system will be found within.
%, such that the integral of over a region of space returns the probability that a system will be found within. %in that region.$|\Psi^{*}\Psi|$ 
%In Born's statistical interpretation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics,[8][9][10] the squared modulus of the wave function, |ψ|2, is a real number interpreted as the probability density of measuring a particle's being detected at a given place – or having a given momentum – at a given time, and possibly having definite values for discrete degrees of freedom. The integral of this quantity, over all the system's degrees of freedom, must be 1 in accordance with the probability interpretation. This general requirement that a wave function must satisfy is called the normalization condition. Since the wave function is complex valued, only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured—its value does not, in isolation, tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables; one has to apply quantum operators, whose eigenvalues correspond to sets of possible results of measurements, to the wave function ψ and calculate the statistical distributions for measurable quantities.
%From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function
%Read the page, it's pretty good. 
Values of $\Psi$ are chosen to be othonormal; % that is, orthogonal and normalised, such that integration of ...
integrating $|\Psi^{2}|$ over all space gives the probability of 1:
\begin{equation}
\braket{\Psi_{i}|\Psi_{j}} = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}
%The above equation just means an integral of Psi_i and Psi_j over 3D Cartesian space. Or something to that effect.  
where all states are represented by $i$ and $j$, and:
\begin{center}
$\delta_{ij}=0$ for $i\neq j$\\
$\delta_{ij}=1$ for $i=j$
%  δij is the Kronecker delta 
% Read Cramer page 107 for more clarfication
the integral is one.
\end{center}
%What does the delta refer to??
%Therefore, for $|\Psi^{2}|$ that has been normalised, the integral over all space is equal to 1, indicating that the probability of finding the system in the space is equal to 1.  %[REF] 
Operators acting on $\Psi$ yield the observable properties of the system. 
% How, and why?
The operator returning the energy of the system is called the the Hamiltonian operator ($\mathbf{H}$).
Erwin Schr\"{o}dinger %first 
proposed his equation in 1926, describing a quantum system using its wave function \cite{schrodinger1926}. %Check this is accurate. Does the equation use the wave function to describe the (energy of the) system, or does the equation just describe the wave function itself?
%The time-independent %Schr\"{o}dinger 
Schr\"{o}dinger's time-independent equation is:
%Unless you know the long form... given in short-form: %(equation \ref{equ:schrodinger}). NB MAKE
%\subsection{The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation} time independent schrodingers
\begin{equation}
%\centering
\mathbf{H}\Psi=E\Psi
\label{equ:schrodinger}
\end{equation}
and the energy of the system is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator:
%The observable, A, of any operator, Aˆ, is given by its expectation value,

\begin{equation} 
E=\braket{\Psi|\mathbf{H}|\Psi} 
\end{equation}
%MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
%where $\mathbf{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $E$ is the energy ofm the system. $\mathbf{H}$ is called the eigenvalue, $\Psi$ the eigenfunction and $E$ is scalar. 
where the Hamiltonian operator $\mathbf{H}$ is an eigenvalue of %the eigenfunction, 
the wave function 
$\Psi$, and $E$ is a scalar denoting the energy of the system. 
A given system may have many acceptable values for $\Psi$, each with an associated value for $E$.
%(Cramer pg 107)

%SEPARATION OF THE wave function:\\
%The $\Psi$ turns to $\psi$, and $\partial$ turns to d, after separation of terms. I don't really know why we changed the notation. But basically, once you start working with the time indepedent Schr, then switch to $\psi$, only. \\
%[Note, time-\textbf{dependent} Schrodinger in one dimension ($x$), and time-independent potential energy for a single particle.] \\
%The wave function evolves in time $\Psi(r_{1}, r_{2}....t)$  according to:
%\begin{equation}
%\textit{i}\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = H\Psi
%\end{equation}
%
%One dimension with time dependency:
%\begin{equation}
%H\Psi = - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{\partial^{2} \Psi}{\partial x^{2}} + V(x)\Psi = \textit{i}\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}
%\end{equation}
%
%Separation of variables:
%\begin{equation}
%\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)\theta(t)
%\end{equation}
%
%Now:
%\begin{equation}
% - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\theta \frac{d^{2} \psi}{d x^{2}} + V(x)\psi \theta = \textit{i}\hbar \psi \frac{d\theta}{dt}
%\end{equation}
%
%Simplifying by dividing by $\psi \theta$:
%\begin{equation}
% - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{1}{\psi} \frac{d^{2} \psi}{d x^{2}} + V(x)= \textit{i}\hbar \frac{1}{\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt}

$\nabla^{2}$ refers to the Laplacian operator, which describes the divergence of the gradient of a field. % It describes how the gradient (the gradient of a function of space) diverges over a function. Field or function? I guess if its a 3D plane function, you can call it a field.

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{T}=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}

%\end{equation}
%Don't know really know why being able to do the above, is important. 
The total, non-relativistic Hamiltonian %Equation \ref{equ:hamiltonian}

%
%Dirac’s equations [REF] present the most complete description of a whole N-electron system by accounting fully for special relativity in the context of quantum mechanics, however many layers of approximation must be adopted in order to arrive at a model that is pliable within computational limitations. In the context of quantum electronic structure calculations it is usually appropriate to exclude the contribution of relativistic effects and nuclear motion, thus applying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. 
%This presents the time independent Schrödinger’s equation \ref{equ:schrodinger}, which the Hartree-Fock approximation and many other electronic structure wave function based methods aim to solve. 
%
%The Hamiltonian operator (Eq. 3) acting on the wave function produces the electronic energy of a many electron system, where each of the terms in the Hamiltonian correspond to kinetic energies of the electrons and nuclei, the attraction of the electrons to the nuclei, and the inter-electronic and inter-nuclear repulsions.7

\subsection{Born-Oppenheimer approximation}
%This maybe should be a paragraph rather than a whole multi-page section
%Get the original reference - might be libo `s reference [27]
In a real system, the motion of elections and nuclei are coupled. Electron density flows dynamically in response to the change in nuclear position and repulsion from other electrons. The correlated motion of particles is described by the pairwise attractive and repulsive terms of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. However, this interdependency makes defining a wave function difficult. 
% results in a wavefuction that is difficult to define. 
%of such a system 
%this representation is unworkable owing to the complexity of considering the interdependent movement of all particles in the system. 
Relative to electronic motion, nuclei move far more slowly, owing to their much greater mass (the mass of a proton is around 1836 times larger than that of the electron). %REF The relaxation time of electrons may be treated as instantaneous, when comparing against that of the nuclei. 
%This difference in electronic and nuclear motion leads
%The difference is such, that the 
Nuclear positions therefore appear essentially stationary when compared to that of the electrons. Exploiting this property, the 
%Owing to this difference in relative  
Born-Oppenheimer approximation fixes the nuclear positions. In this way, the motion of electrons and nuclei can be decoupled, and the electronic properties of the system may be calculated for the given nuclear coordinates. Dependency on the nuclear kinetic energy term ($\mathbf{T}_{N}$) %of the Hamiltonian 
is removed, as the nuclei are frozen. % becomes then independent of electronic motion; 
%The electron-nuclear interaction term ($\mathbf{V}_{e-N}$) disappears, and 
The nuclear-nuclear repulsive term ($\mathbf{V}_{n-n}$) becomes a constant for the specified geometry.  
Equation \ref{equ:hamiltonian} is reduced to its electronic components and nuclear constants which in atomic units can be written as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{T}_{e} + \mathbf{V}_{e-N}+ \mathbf{V}_{e-e} + \mathbf{V}_{n-n}
%\label{equ:BO}
%\end{equation}
% With AU:
\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{H}= - \frac{1}{2} \sum \nabla_i^{2} - \sum_{i} \sum_{k} \frac{Z_{k}}{r_{ik}} + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}} + \mathbf{V}_{n-n}
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{T}_{e} + \mathbf{V}_{e-N}+ \mathbf{V}_{e-e} + \mathbf{V}_{n-n}
\label{equ:hamiltonian_BO}
\end{equation}
% Probably don't need this section ----------------------------------------------------------%
%Or in terms of the operators:
%\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{T}_{e} + \mathbf{V}_{e-N}+ \mathbf{V}_{e-e} + \mathbf{V}_{n-n}
%\label{equ:hamiltonian_BO_op}
%\end{equation}
%
and the electronic terms can be collected into one term, to simplify notation:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}= \mathbf{H}_{el}+ \mathbf{V}_{n-n}
\label{equ:hamiltonian_BO_simp}
\end{equation}
%
The Schr\"{o}dinger’s equation can now be written in terms of only the electronic coordinates: 
%CHECK THIS IS ACCURATE
%
\begin{equation}
(\mathbf{H}_{el} + \mathbf{V}_{n-n})
%Should the E have the el? When H_el and VNN are added, surely it gives the BO approx for E rather than just E_el? But then the wavefucntion is el too.. hmmm
%If I do change it, make sure to propagate through subsequent paragraph
%\Psi_{el}(\mathbf{q}_{i};\mathbf{q}_{k})=E(\mathbf{q}_{i};\mathbf{q}_{k})
\Psi_{el}(\mathbf{q}_{i};\mathbf{q}_{k})=E_{el}(\mathbf{q}_{i};\mathbf{q}_{k})
\label{equ:elec_schro}
\end{equation}
%where $\mathbf{H}_{el}$ is the pure electronic Hamiltonian, that is, only including the electronic kinetic energy , electron-nuclear attractive term, and electron-electron repulsion term from the total Hamiltonian given in \ref{equ:hamiltonian}. $\mathbf{V}_{n-n}$ is the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, constant for the fixed positions. %And so can be an additive term at the end. 
where the electronic coordinates are given by $\mathbf{q}_{i}$, the stationary nuclear positions by $\mathbf{q}_{k}$ and 
$E_{el}$ is the electronic energy of the system. The values of $\mathbf{q}_{i}$ are independent variables, whereas the values of $\mathbf{q}_{k}$ are parameters. %Set parameters WAIT DID I EVEN COPY THIS RIGHT, WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND AM I MISSING A \Psi

\subsection{Slater determinants}
% A method of expressing the wave function, such that it obeys Pauli's
%Summed up as - antisymmetry and 
% A paragrah to talk about how exchange is the difficult bit to solve?
In a system of multiple electrons, each electron is indistinguishable. If the positions of two electrons are swapped, the distribution of electron density in the system remains the same. %\cite{Leach2001}. 
The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions, such as electrons, may simultaneously occupy the same quantum state within the same system. When considering an atom with two or more electrons, this means that none may have the same set of quantum numbers. %say what they are?
As a result, for two equivalent electrons, the wave function of the system is antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of their coordinates: 
%must therefore change sign upon the interchange of their coordinates
%permutation of their coordinates. %is this an imprecise statement?
%https://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/hughbanks/courses/673/handouts/antisymmetry.pdf
\begin{equation}
\Psi(1,2..i,...j..N) = - \Psi(1,2..i,...j..N)
\end{equation}

%or
%\begin{equation}
%\Phi(\mathbf{X}_{1},\mathbf{X}_{2}) = - Phi(\mathbf{X}_{2},\mathbf{X}_{1})
%\end{equation} 

%These antisymmetry 
This requirement is fulfilled by expressing the wave function as a Slater determinant, which changes sign with permutation of the coordinates of two electrons. 
%What is a determinant anyway
In the case of a multi-electronic system, the generalised Slater determinant for $N$ total electrons is as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\psi_{SD} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\begin{vmatrix}
\chi_{1}(1) 	& \chi_{2}(1) 	&\cdots 	& \chi_{N}(1) \\
\chi_{1}(2) 	& \chi_{2}(2) 	&\cdots 	& \chi_{N}(2) \\
\vdots 		& \vdots 			& \ddots 	& \vdots 		   \\ 
\chi_{1}(N) & \chi_{2}(N) 	&\cdots 	& \chi_{N}(N) 
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}\\
%\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} is a normalisation factor - Mats linder thesis 2012
where $\chi_{N}$ represents single electron wave functions, or spin-orbitals \cite{Slater1929}. %which are orthonormal
In the context of a molecule, the single electron wave functions are molecular orbitals. 
Rows are labelled by the coordinates of each electron: (1), (2) $\cdots$ ($N$), whereas each column uses a different orbital function: $\chi_{1}$, $\chi_{2} \cdots$, $\chi_{N}$.
%
%Rows are labelled by the coordinates of each electron: (1), (2) $\cdots$ ($N$)
%Rows are labelled by the coordinates of each electron: $\textbf{x}_{1}$,$ \textbf{x}_{2}\cdots \textbf{x}_{N}$, whereas each column uses a different orbital function: $\chi_{1}$, $\chi_{2} \cdots$, $\chi_{N}$.
%The orbitals increase along the columns, whilst electron coordinates run down the rows. 
%If the labels of (1) and (2) are exchanged, the rows of the determinant are exchanged
%If the labels of $\textbf{x}_{1}$ and $\textbf{x}_{2}$ are exchanged, 
If the labels of (1) and (2) are exchanged, 
the rows of the determinant are exchanged; a general property of determinants is that the interchange of two rows leads to a change of sign. The expanded form of the determinant ($\psi_{SD}$) will have the opposite sign when a pair of electronic coordinates are switched, by switching rows within the determinant, thereby fulfilling the antisymmetry requirement. 
In the dis-allowed case of two equivalent electrons occupying the same spin-orbital, two columns would be identical \cite{Dykstra1994}. The evaluation of the determinant would then be zero, indicating that the probability of two electrons with identical spin occupying the same orbital was zero. 
%Application of the Slater determinant therefore fulfils the Pauli exclusion principle.

\subsection{Variational principle}
\label{sect:variational_principle}
%https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:548763/FULLTEXT01.pdf
In order to obtain the ground state energy of a system, %They aren't really looking for the ground state, in an excited state / ground state sense. But rather a placement of electrions, sense. Not sure if this terminology is correct here...
the wave function giving the lowest energy must be found. %Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, 
This corresponds to the electronic configuration with lowest value of $E_{el}$. Difficulty then arises, as ground state energy cannot be computed exactly. 
The variational theorem states that the calculated energy of any guess wave function can only be greater than or equal to the real ground-state energy ($E_{0}$) of the system. % The concept of \''lower bound'' is a property of wave functions? How is this derived, and where does it stem from?
This provides a criterion for selection of the best guess wave function, as the energy is always bounded from below, where: 
%make sure you know what this means and whether the hat is appropriate
%\begin{equation}
%E_{exact} \leq {\langle \Psi | \hat{H} | \Psi \rangle}
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
E = \langle \Psi | \mathbf{H} | \Psi \rangle \geq E_{0}
%E_{0} \leq {\langle \Psi | \mathbf{H} | \Psi \rangle}
% Normalised
%E_{el} = \frac{\langle \psi | \mathbf{H} | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} \leq E_{0} 
\end{equation}
for a normalised wave function. % in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. 
Thus, when choosing between different trial wave functions, the solution with the lowest energy is the one closest to the exact value. % The best wave function is therefore when the energy is at a minimum and the first derivative of the energy is equal to zero (\textdelta E = 0.) 

%Thus, when choosing a trial wavefunction, the expectation value (${\langle \Psi | \mathbf{H} | \Psi \rangle}$) is minimised ...
%This is called the variational principle, whereby the lowest energy 
%%Jensen pg 87
%The energy of an approximate wave function can be calculated as the expectation
%value of the Hamiltonian operator, divided by the norm of the wave function.
%\begin{equation}
%E_{el} = \frac{\langle \psi | \mathbf{H} | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle}
%\end{equation}
%For a normalized wave function the denominator is 1, and therefore $E_{el} = {\langle \psi | \mathbf{H} | \psi \rangle}$.
%

\subsection{Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method}
In practice, equation \ref{equ:elec_schro} can only be solved \textit{exactly} in very few circumstances; no exact solutions can be found for problems involving three or more interacting particles, such as in the case of a helium atom possessing two electrons and one proton. %VIVA: Why? - the correlated interaction between the partices which cannot be calculated exactly. 
For systems of complexity greater than one electron, further approximations must be made. %like what?

The \ac{HF} approximation was the first practically applicable method for calculation of the ground-state energy of atoms with fixed nuclear positions.  
%Need some preamble here, how did we get from slater and BO, to Hartree's method? 
%Not sure what this means, nor which they refer to:
% The product form of an electronic wave function is only obtainable \textit{via} and approximation. 
%The electronic Hamiltonian (equation \ref\label{equ:hamiltonian_BO_op}) is not separable for individual electrons. 
%This is prevented by the electron-electron repulsion term/ operator - an exact wave function cannot be determined as a product of the one electron function (from Slater's ?). 
%The electron-electron repulsion term 
%As the schrodingers equation cannot be solved analytically for systems with more than one electrion, 
%The \ac{SCF} method iteratively determines a set of molecular orbitals that minimises the energy of the wave function, treating the interaction of each electron as in a static field of all other electrons in the system.
%
The \ac{SCF} method was proposed by Hartree in 1928 \cite{Hartree1928,Hartree1929}. 
%https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3638&context=edissertations
%The method is an independent-particle model. %Each electron  % all electronic interactions treated are instead averaged into a static field. 
$N$ electrons are treated as individual particles occupying single-electron spin orbitals and move independently of the dynamics of any other fermions in the system. 
%%without the effect of the surrounding fermions. 
%This is also referred to as the Mean-Field approximation; 
The effective interaction of one electron with all other fermions is averaged and applied as a static external field, in the form of a spherical potential around the electron (called the mean-field approximation). 
In this way, the $N$-body problem is reduced to a 1-body problem. 
%This assumption places a static spherical potential aroun	d the electron, derived from the average effect of the nucleus and other electrons in the system.

The approximation neglects exchange in the electron-electron interaction; %describing the energy of electrons as individual particles moving independently of the dynamics of any other fermions in the system. 
the calculated Hartree wavefunction alone does not include any contribution from electron correlation, and incorrectly implies that the electrons are distinguishable. %if you don't know why this is, omit it. 
%NOTE the difference between exchange - the non-classical effect of electrons of differing spin, and correlation, which is due to the instantaneous interactions that are not captured by the static models. (And which every other contribution to the difference to the ``real'' energy is lumped in.)
Fock developed this idea by introducing Slater determinant wave functions \cite{Fock1930}. 
The effects of exchange on the coulombic repulsion were incorporated, achieved by taking the trial wave function as a single Slater determinant. %again, if you don't know how or why this is, omit it.

For an electron in orbital $\chi_{i}$ in the field of nuclei $M$ and other electrons $\chi_{j}$, the Hamiltonian operator is comprised of three terms, corresponding to the three contributions to the energy. 
The core Hamiltonian operator, $\mathbf{H}^{core}$ %(1)$ 
comprises of the kinetic energy of each electron, and the electron-nuclear interaction: % `` the energy of each electron moving in the field of the bar nuclei'')
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}^{core}(1)= - \frac{1}{2} \nabla^{2}_{1} - \sum^{M}_{A=1}\frac{Z_{A}}{r_{1A}}
\end{equation}
%
where %$\mathbf{H}^{core}$ is the core Hamiltonian operator, ($M$ are all the nuclei)
%$A$ is the nucleus / normalisation constant?, 
$Z_{A}$ is the nuclear charge and $r_{1A}$ is the %normalised electron-nuclear separation. 
separation of electron (1) with nucleus A. %halved to remove duplicity / double counting 
In a mono-electronic system, this would be the only operator present. 

The coulomb operator, $\mathbf{J}_{j}$ %(1)$ average coulomb potential
corresponds to the averaged interaction potential between each pair of electrons in the same orbital, and with other electrons in other orbitals $\chi_{j}$:
%electron-electron repulsion
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{J}_{j}(1)=\int d\tau_{2}\chi_{j}(2)\frac{1}{r_{12}}\chi_{j}(2)
\end{equation}
%(Now electrons are the big numbers and the little i and j's are the orbitals)
where $d\tau_{i}$ indicates the integration is over the spatial and spin coordinates of electron $i$, and $r_{12}$ is the distance between the two electrons. 
%corresponding to the averaged interaction potential due to an electron in orbital $\chi_{j}$.

The exchange operator $\mathbf{K}_{j}$ %(1)$  non-local exchange potential
, is only non-zero for electrons with the same spin, arising due to the antisymmetry of the wavefunction: % / Slater dterminant - Leach pg 46, also see ``repulsive contribution'' on pg 206. As two nuclei move closer, electrons of the same spin move out of the way, causing a depletion of electron density in the internuclear space, thus increasing the internuclear repulsion due to deshielding. At short distances the interaction energy increases as $1/r$, at large distances the energy decays exponentially as $e^{-2r/a_{0}}$ however ($a_{0}$ is the Bohr radius). 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{K}_{j}(1)\chi_{i}(1)=\Big[\int d\tau_{2}\chi_{j}(2)\frac{1}{r_{12}}\chi_{j}(2)\Big]\chi_{j}(1)
\end{equation}
defined in terms of its effect when acting on $\chi_{i}$. 
% \ac{HF} 
The Hamiltonian operator % for electron in $\chi_{i}$ 
written in terms of its core, coulomb and exchange contributions is as follows: %K is negative because of antisymmetry
\begin{equation}
\Big[\mathbf{H}^{core}(1)+\sum^{N}_{j=1}\{\mathbf{J}_{j}(1)-\mathbf{K}_{j}(1)\}\Big]\chi_{i}(1)=\sum^{N}_{j=1}\varepsilon_{ij}\chi_{j}(1)
\end{equation}
%WHAT is \varepsilon_{ij}?
and can be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F}_{i}\chi_{i}=\sum_{j}\varepsilon_{ij}\chi_{j}
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{F}_{i}$ is the Fock operator, and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the energy of orbital $\chi_{j}$. 
%  $\varepsilon$ is the diagonal matrix of orbital energies. Each of its elements $\varepsilon_{i}$ is the energy of  orbital $\chi_{i}$.
%The approximation, therefore, lacks any electron correlation (other than in the average sense) and may lead to large errors in the energy:
%for example, band gaps in some semiconductors and bond-length in some molecules are badly
%described. https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/137543092/thesis.pdf
The operator is a one electron Hamiltonian for an electron in a multi-electron system. 
For ``closed shell'' problems where there are no unpaired electrons, the operator has the form:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F}_{i}(1)=\mathbf{H}^{core}(1)+\sum^{N/2}_{j=1}\{2\mathbf{J}_{j}(1)-\mathbf{K}_{j}(1)\}

\subsection{Open shell systems}
The forced pairing of electrons of opposing spin into a shared orbital is referred to as the \textit{restricted} scheme (figure \ref{fig:RHF_ROHF_UHF}). %, (e.g. R\acs{B3LYP}).  You haven't described functionals yet
For closed shell systems, this treatment is appropriate. For species with unpaired electron spin such as in transition metal complexes or radicals, an alternative model allowing singly occupied orbitals must be adopted.

The \textit{restricted-open} %e.g.RO\asc{B3LYP}, 
scheme maintains electron pairing within orbitals except in the case of the \ac{HOMO}, which is singly occupied.
An alternative model is the \textit{unrestricted} scheme, %(U\acs{B3LYP}), 
where all electrons are unpaired and reside in their own orbitals. % (Figure 9). 
A caveat of the unrestricted model is its susceptibility to spin contamination, which has consequences at large bond separations. 
% where the bond has not completely broken.
%Explain what spin contamination is, and whether we have to deal with it here. It was not super prevalent in our study - whilst we did looking at bond breaking, the energy at large separations was only used as a quantitative indication that a reaction was likely to take place / give a suggestion of the geometry of the product complex.

\subsection{Electron correlation}
The energy difference between the real energy and the result obtained from \ac{HF} is called the correlation energy, $E_{corr.}$. % \textit{correlation energy}.
\begin{equation}
E_{corr.}=E_{exact}-E_{HF}
\end{equation}
The $E_{corr.}$ term can be divided into two components. The static correlation component arises as a system cannot be fully described by a single set of \ac{MO}s, %from the imperfect of a single set of molecular orbitals in describing a system,
and the dynamic correlation contribution derives from the neglect of instantaneous electron repulsion interactions. % of the same spin, beyond exchange. 
The latter includes the description of instantaneous dipolar interactions, leading to Van der Waals forces, which are lost when the electron repulsion terms are averaged. 
%when non-bonding interactions are involved, such as in hydrogen bonding systems and during bond fission where the dissociating species are at a large separation, instantaneous dipolar effects. Van der Waals. 
Post-\ac{HF} methods such as perturbation theory and coupled-cluster techniques aim to %redress this dis %close this gap, 
account for the difference by inclusion of the contribution from correlation as an additive term, or \textit{via} multi-electron wave functions. %NOT multi reference - this is for excited states / CI and REF

\subsection{Hohenberg-Kohn formalism}
Modern \ac{DFT} is based on two fundamental theorems proposed by Hohenberg and Kohn in 1964 \cite{Hohenberg1964}. %REF 
The first theorem states that for the ground state of system, there exists a unique energy and non-degenerate electron density. The density can therefore be used to determine the Hamiltonian of a system, thereby also describing its ground state energy $E[\rho(r)]$%$E_{g}$
, wave function and other properties of the system. The energy is functional of the density: %ref and other properties
%https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/137543092/thesis.pdf
\begin{equation}
%E[\rho]=\mathbf{T_{e}[\rho]+\mathbf{V}_{e-e}[\rho]+\mathbf{V}_{e-N}[\rho]
%E_{g}
E[\rho(r)]=\int \rho(r) V(r) \,d(r) + F[\rho(r)]
\label{equ:DFT}
\end{equation}
$V(r)$ is the external potential; the first term arises from interaction of electrons with $V(r)$, usually a coulombic attraction between electrons and nuclei. $F[\rho(r)]$ is a universal functional of the density, representing the total kinetic energy and electron-electron repulsion. %Bowlers notes
%, $V(r)$ is the external potential uniquely determined by $\rho(r)$.  NO, that is V_(ext), silly. vext(r) is the potential representing the total nuclear attraction of the electrons in addition to any other external potential
%where the energy of the system $E[\rho]$ can be obtained \textit{via} the sum of the kinetic energy of the electrons $\mathbf{T_{e}[\rho]$, electron-electron repulsion $\mathbf{V}_{e-e}[\rho]$ and electron-nucleus attraction $\mathbf{V}_{e-N}[\rho]$ derived as a function of the electron density. 
%https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b0de/c00cd81492b681c897249672ee8f42c79d34.pdf 
The second theorem states that the ground state energy can be obtained \textit{via} minimisation of $E[\rho(r)]$. Since equation \ref{equ:DFT} gives the exact energy of the original Hamiltonian, by applying the variational principle, the lowest possible value of $E[\rho(r)]$ gives the exact solution for energy and therefore $E[\rho(r)]$. However, it is not possible to explicitly express $F[\rho(r)]$ in terms of $\rho(r)$, so its exact form is not known. It is not possible to verify that the found density giving lowest value for $E[\rho(r)]$ corresponds to a wave function obeying the Pauli exclusion principle requirements for antisymmetry. These issues were addressed by the Kohn and Sham. 
%\ac{wb97xd} is a range separated hybrid with D (self consistent exchange). 
%It is more computationally demanding than just post HF style perturbation theory exchange (as in B3LYP, using MP2 exchange for example  - fact check that). And according to the paper by Najibi and Goerigk even the D3 correction isn't better than the perturbation theory style exchange, for a massive amount of datasets that they tested. SO why even use this in the first place? Look to the origianl paper where it was published and see how they tout this method.

%You know pople's one's aren't as stable as the aug- ones. State why you chose them. Also, MP2 will react differently with these bases as opposed to the aug- ones. 
A basis set is the collection of mathematical basis functions, used in linear combination, to construct the \ac{MO}. An individual \ac{MO} can be defined as: %The individual function are derived from the hydrogen atomic orbitals, as it is 
\begin{equation}
\psi_{i}=\sum^{K}_{\mu=1} c_{\mu i} \chi_{\mu}
\end{equation}
where $c_{\mu i}$ is the molecular orbital expansion coefficient and $\chi_{\mu}$ corresponds to the one-electron occupied orbitals, often atomic orbitals, also called \textit{basis functions}. %I don't see why we don't just call it \chi_{i} again. So it's not

$K$ is the total number of basis functions, which are all chosen to be normalised.

%Roman subscripts on MO functions and Greek on basis functions
The smallest possible basis set is a single basis per occupied orbital on each atom in a molecular system, termed the ``minimal basis''. The \ac{HF} limit is when the addition of further bases does not lower the energy of the system any further. 

\ac{STO} with exponential dependence $Ae^{-\alpha r}$, were the first choice for atomic functions; $\alpha$  controls how quickly the function decays (radial extent), with higher values for higher effective nuclear charge. They are extremely similar in their mathematical expression to the real atomic orbital, however, are difficult to implement in molecular orbital calculations.

Split valence basis sets describe the core electrons with fewer basis functions than the interacting valence electrons, as they are not as significant in bonding or intermolecular interactions. In this study, the widely used Pople basis sets will be applied. %REF % (Table 1. Examples of split valence basis sets.).40,41 

Basis set superposition error (BSSE) is a false lowering of the energy that can occur when two species in a system approach one another to form a complex. Particle A borrows the extra basis functions belonging to particle B and an artificial stabilisation is observed. The error arises from the inconsistency in treatment between the individual particles at long separations and the complex at short distances. The effect is particularly pronounced for smaller basis sets.% Counterpoise correction I used to circumvent BSSE, at the expense of higher computational resources required for the calculation.

\subsection{Transition state searches}
%[Maybe this goes into a smaller metholodogy section?]
Transition state searches are called through the Opt=TS, QST or QST3 keywords. The Opt=TS method in \ac{G09} attempts to optimise the given “guess” geometry to a transition state. The guess structure can be obtained from a geometry scan, manually constructed or generated using the QST2 function. In many cases, a TS alone will not be able to isolate the suitable transition state and is usually used in conjunction the QST2 or QST3 methods, and combined with other techniques such as frequency calculations. 
The QST2 option is able to generate a transition state geometry using the Synchronous Transit Quasi-Newton (STQN) method. %42 REF. 
Here the transition geometry is midway between a given reactant and product. The corresponding atoms labels must match in both the starting and end products.  QST3 performs similarly, but also considers a guess transition state. % (Figure 10). 
It is widely acknowledged that transition state searching is challenging; in addition to the techniques above, the task requires perhaps a certain measure of chemical intuition.
“Scan” means that the reaction coordinates are changed gradually and “relaxed” means that the reaction coordinates are fixed, while other coordinates that are orthogonal to the reaction coordinates are relaxed during the energy minimisation \cite{Yao2018}.

%Imaginary frequencies and the Hessian
%If the second derivative is positive at a point, the graph is concave up. If the second derivative is positive at a critical point, then the critical point is a local minimum.
%If the second derivative is negative at a point, the graph is concave down. If the second derivative is negative at a critical point, then the critical point is a local maximum.
%An inflection point marks the transition from concave up and concave down. The second derivative will be zero at an inflection point.

%\subsection{Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate}
%%[Maybe this goes into a smaller metholodogy section?]
%IRC calculations begin at the saddle point and descend the PES in both the forwards and backwards direction of the reaction co-ordinate dictated by the normal mode of the imaginary frequency. In a similar manner to a geometry scan, geometry optimisations are performed at each step point. Its purpose is to connect the two minima leading to the found transition state, thereby confirming whether the found transition state corresponds to your reactants and products of interest. 
%IRC calculations are called via the IRC keyword, with specifications of whether the forward or backward reaction is to be scanned, step size and maximum number of steps allowed.
%
%%not sure whether to talk about the transistion state searching methods / algorithms here or elsewhere, or whether to go into detail at all.
\subsection{PES Scans}
%[Maybe this goes into a smaller methodology section?]
Relaxed potential energy surface (PES) scans, or geometry scans are used to probe the local energy landscape corresponding to specific change in geometry. During the course of a scan, a selected bond length, angle or dihedral is adjusted in incremental steps, as specified by the given scan parameters. At each step, the adjusted parameter is frozen and a geometry optimisation is performed, allowing the rest of the system to relax around the modified bond.  Each scan yields a PES of the explored pathway, presented in a reaction co-ordinate diagram. % (see Figure 17, section 2.4.1).
An energy maximum followed by a trough indicates a transition state and intermediate reaction product, respectively. The structural co-ordinates at the points of interest are extracted and used for subsequent frequency calculations, transition state searches and validated using intrinsic reaction co-ordinate methods. 
To explore the predicted degradation mechanisms, the scanning parameter was assigned to the bond undergoing the most significant transformation during a particular step of the mechanism. In the case that more than one significant bond was altered, multiple scans with different bond specifications were compared. 
Geometry scans were performed on the optimised reactant geometry using the Opt=ModRedundant keyword.

A rigid scan consists of a single point energy calculation of the structure at each of step the scan. % change in coo-rdinates.
A relaxed scans calls for a geometry optimisation at each of these points. 
Two-dimensional scans may be used to probe simultaneous processes in the system. These are specified in \ac{G09} by selecting two internal coordinates to be scanned, and stating the number of steps.

\subsection{Topology analysis using \ac{QTAIM}}
%Some real space functions in Multiwfn are available for topology analysis, such as electron density, its Laplacian, orbital wave function, ELF, LOL ...
Topology analysis is a method of obtaining useful properties from the 3D representation of ...%the electron density derived during a quantum mechanical calculation. 
Bader proposed a technique to analyse the electron density in the \ac{QTAIM} \cite{Bader1991}.
 %, which also extended to other real space functions, such as the \ac{LOL} and \ac{ELF}. - Only include these if you can describe them, also. 
 % Real-space calculation...when all operators (T^,V^,J^,K^) are evaluated on a grid.
 %
%The topology analysis technique proposed by Bader was firstly used for analysing electron density in "atoms in molecules" (AIM) theory, which is also known as "the quantum theory of atoms in molecules" (QTAIM), this technique has also been extended to other real space functions, e.g. the first topology analysis research of ELF for small molecules is given by Silvi and Savin.%, see Nature, 371, 683. 
The points in the topological landscape at which the gradient norm is zero, excluding points at infinity, %does infinity happen?
% wiki: a norm is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to each vector in a vector space—except for the zero vector, which is assigned a length of zero.
% A bit like modulus but referers to specific scenarios: https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-is-the-difference-between-norm-and-modulus.181812/
signify a stationary point. These are deemed Critical Points (\acs{CP}).  In the context of electron density, these point can be classified into four types:
%In topology analysis language, the points at where gradient norm of function value is zero (except at infinity) are called as critical points (CPs), CPs can be classified into four types according to how many eigenvalues of Hessian matrix of real space function are negative.

%At this point you shoudl have already explained what the hessian matrix is
%please explaint the (3,X) labelling
\ac{NCP}: All three eigenvalues of Hessian matrix of the function are negative, also known as the local maximum. %For electron density analysis and for heavy atoms, the position of (3,-3) are nearly identical to nuclear positions, hence (3,-3) is also called nuclear critical point (NCP). Generally the number of (3,-3) is equal to the number of atoms, only in rarely cases the former can be more than (e.g. Li2) or less than (e.g. KrH+) the latter.
As the position of (3,-3) are generally located at nuclear positions, these are referred to as Nuclear Critical Points (\acs{NCP}). The number of \ac{NCP} is usually equal to the number of atoms, though there are exceptions, such as a greater number of \ac{NCP} for \ce{Li2} or a lower number for \ce{KrH+}. %Why???

%Btw real space.... just means space. As in actual 3D space. Not virtual space. 
%In a electronic structure (specifically DFT) code, a "real space code" means using atom orbitals as basis functions rather than plane waves.

(3,-1): Two eigenvalues of Hessian matrix of function are negative, or a second-order saddle point. (3,-1) usually appears between attractive atom pairs and so are referred to as a Bonding Critical Points (\acs{BCP}). %The value of real space functions at BCP have great significance. %, for example the value of XXX and 
As the electron density af 
 \ac{BCP} is closely related to bonding strength and bonding type respectively in analogous bonding type. % (The Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules-From Solid State to DNA and Drug Design, p11); 
\cite{Matta2007}
The potential energy density at BCP has been shown to be highly correlated with hydrogen bond energies% (Chem. Phys. Lett., 285, 170)
; local information entropy at BCP is a good indicator of aromaticity.% (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 12, 4742).

(3,+1): Only one eigenvalue of Hessian matrix of function is negative, namely first-order saddle point (like transition state in potential energy surface). For electron density analysis, (3,+1) generally appears in the center of ring system and displays steric effect, hence (3,+1) is often named as ring critical point (RCP).

(3,+3): None of eigenvalues of Hessian matrix of function are negative, namely the local minimum. For electron density analysis, (3,+3) generally appears in the center of cage system (e.g. pyramid P4 molecule), hence is often referred to as cage critical point (CCP).

The positions of CPs are searched by Newton method, one need to assign an initial guess point, then the Newton iteration always converge to the CP that is closest to the guess point. By assigning different guesses and doing iteration for each of them, all CPs could be found. Once searches of CPs are finished, one should use Poincaré-Hopf relationship to verify if all CPs may have been found, the relationship states that (for isolated system)
\begin{equation}
\centering
n(3,-3) – n(3,-1) + n(3,+1) – n(3,+3) = 1
\end{equation}
%If the relationship is unsatisfied, then some of CPs must be missing, you may need to try to search those CPs by different guesses. However even if the relationship is satisfied, it does not necessarily mean that all CPs have been found. Notice that the function spaces of ELF/LOL and Laplacian of XX are much more complex than XXX, it is very difficult to locate all CPs for these functions, especially for middle and large system, so, you can stop trying for searching CPs once all CPs that you are interested in have been found.

 The maximal gradient path linking BCP and associated two local maxima of density is termed as “bond path”, which reveals atomic interaction path for all kinds of bonding. The collection of bond paths is known as molecular graph, which provides an unambiguous definition of molecular structure. Bond path can be straight line or curve, obviously for the latter case the length of bond path is longer than the sum of the distances between BCP and associated two (3,-3) CPs.
%Let us see an example. In the complex shown below, the imidazole plane is vertical to magnesium porphyrin plane, the nitrogen in imidazole coordinated to magnesium. Magenta, orange and yellow spheres correspond to (3,-3), (3,-1) and (3,+1) critical points, brown lines denote bond paths.

%Comment on the different methods used to calculate NMR parameters - a tiny literature review, if you will, and say which you'll be using, why - even if it's becuase of the fact that it's built into Gaussian (obviously big it up, if that is the case) - and state any caveats.
