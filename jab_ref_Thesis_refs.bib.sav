  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the extension of the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) to a much broader range of organic systems. It also describes a preliminary parameterization of MMFF94 for the hydronium and hydroxide ions and for various halide, alkalai, and alkalai earth ions as well as for such “protein” metals as Zn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Cu+, Fe2+, and Fe3+. The extension employed computational data on charge distributions, molecular geometries, and conformational energies for a series of oxysulfur (particularly sulfonamide) and oxyphosphorous compounds and for a diverse set of small molecules and ions not covered in the core parameterization. It also employed experimental data for approximately 2800 good-quality structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Some of the additional computational data were used to extend the explicit parameterization of electrostatic interactions and to more widely define a useful additive approximation for the “bond polarity” parameters (bond charge increments) used in MMFF94. Both the experimental and computational data served to define reference bond lengths and angles that the extended force field uses in conjunction with force constants obtained from carefully calibrated empirical rules. The extended torsion parameters consist partly of explicit parameters derived to reproduce MP2/6-31G* conformational energies and partly of “default parameters” provided by empirical rules patterned after those used in DREIDING and UFF but calibrated, where possible, against computationally derived MMFF94 torsion parameters. Comparisons to experimental data show that MMFF94 reproduces crystallographic bond lengths and bond angles with relatively modest root mean square (rms) deviations of approx. 0.02 Å and 2°, respectively. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for conformational energies, rotational barriers, and equilibrium torsion angles. It describes the derivation of the torsion parameters from high-quality computational data and characterizes MMFF94's ability to reproduce both computational and experimental data, the latter particularly in relation to MM3. The computational data included: (i) ∼ 250 comparisons of conformational energy based on “MP4SDQ/TZP” calculations (triple-zeta plus polarization calculations at a defined approximation to the highly correlated MP4SDQ level) at MP2/6-31G* geometries; and (ii) ∼ 1200 MP2/TZP comparisons of “torsion profile” structures at geometries derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries. The torsion parameters were derived in restrained least-squares fits that used the complete set of available computational data, thereby ensuring that a fully optimal set of parameters would be obtained. The final parameters reproduce the “MP4SDQ/TZP” and MP2/TZP computational data with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.31 and 0.50 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces a set of 37 experimental gas-phase and solution conformational energies, enthalpies, and free energies with a rms deviation of 0.38 kcal/mol; for comparison, the “MP4SDQ/TZP” calculations and MM3 each gives a rms deviation of 0.37 kcal/mol. Furthermore, MMFF94 reproduces 28 experimentally determined rotational barriers with a rms deviation of 0.39 kcal/mol. Given the diverse nature of the experimental conformational energies and rotational barriers and the clear indications of experimental error in some cases, the MMFF94 results appear excellent. Nevertheless, MMFF94 encounters somewhat greater difficulty in handling multifunctional compounds that place highly polar functional groups in close proximity, probably because it, like other commonly used force fields, too greatly simplifies the description of electrostatic interactions. Some suggestions for enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are discussed. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article defines the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for intermolecular interactions. It specifies the novel “buffered” functional forms used for treating van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interactions, and describes the use of : (1) high quality ab initio data to parameterize vdW interactions involving aliphatic hydrogens; and (2) HF/6-31G* calculations on hydrogen-bonded complexes to parameterize nonbonded interactions in polar systems. Comparisons show that appropriate trends in the HF/6-31G* data are well reproduced by MMFF94 and that intermolecular interaction energies and geometries closely parallel those given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. A proper balance between solvent–solvent, solvent–solute, and solute–solute interactions, critically important for prospective success in aqueous simulations, thus appears to be attained. Comparison of MMFF94, OPLS, CHELPG electrostatic potential fit, QEq, Gasteiger, and Abraham charges for 20 small molecules and ions also shows the close correspondence between MMFF94 and OPLS. As do OPLS and all current, widely used force fields, MMFF94 employs “effective pair potentials” which incorporate in an averaged way the increases in polarity which occur in high dielectric media. Some limitations of this approach are discussed and suggestions for possible enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are noted. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for molecular geometries and deformations. It defines the form used for the valence-coordinate terms that represent variations in bond lengths and angles, and it describes the derivation of quadratic force constants from HF/6-31G* data and the derivation of reference bond lengths and angles from fits to MP2/6-31G*-optimized geometries. Comparisons offered show that MMFF94 accurately reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization and demonstrate that its derivation from such data simultaneously confers the ability to reproduce experiment. In particular, MMFF94 reproduces experimentally determined bond lengths and angles for 30 organic molecules with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.014 Å and 1.2°, respectively. MM3 reproduces bond angles to the same accuracy, but reproduces experimental bond lengths more accurately, in part because it was fit directly to thermally averaged experimental bond lengths; MMFF94, in contrast, was fit to (usually shorter) energy-minimum values, as is proper for an anharmonic force field intended for use in molecular-dynamics simulations. The comparisons also show that UFF and a recent version of CHARMm (QUANTA 3.3 parameterization) are less accurate for molecular geometries than either MMFF94 or MM3. For vibrational frequencies, MMFF94 and MM3 give comparable overall rms deviations versus experiment of 61 cm−1 and 57 cm−1, respectively, for 15 small, mostly organic molecules. In a number of instances, MM3's derivation employed observed frequencies that differ substantially—by nearly 400 cm−1 in one case—from other published frequencies which had themselves been confirmed theoretically by good-quality ab initio calculations. Overall, the comparisons to experimental geometries and vibrational frequencies demonstrate that MMFF94 achieves MM3-like accuracy for organic systems for which MM3 has been parameterized. Because MMFF94 is derived mainly from computational data, however, it has been possible to parameterize MMFF94 with equal rigor for a wide variety of additional systems for which little or no useful experimental data exist. Equally good performance can be expected for such systems. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Both the direct and angular attacks of OH− in the hydrolysis reactions were considered. Geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level both in the gas phase and in bulk water solution. Effect of bulk water solution was modeled using the PCM approach. Nature of potential energy surfaces of the local minima and transition states was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were also performed to validate the computed transition state structures. Effect of electron correlation on computed energies was considered at the MP2/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. It was found that the angular attack of OH− in the hydrolysis reaction will require significantly larger activation energy than the direct attack. Computed transition states correspond to the structure where the presence of hydrogen bonds between the OH− and various sites of nitrocellulose was the necessary stabilizing factor. The ring breaking through the C-O ring bond was not found to be the first step in the alkaline hydrolysis reactions. It was predicted that alkaline hydrolysis would be driven by the addition-elimination (substitution) reaction starting at the C3 site and will progress in the C2 → C6 direction. Entropy of system in water solution will have profound effect on alkaline hydrolysis reaction of nitrocellulose.},

  abstract  = {We have computed consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the anti-E2, syn-E2, and SN2 pathways of X− + CH3CH2X with X = F and Cl. This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). The ab initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) < SN2 (X = F) < SN2 (X = Cl) ∼ syn-E2 (X = F) < anti-E2 (X = Cl) < syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F− + CH3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl− + CH3CH2Cl, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway. Best overall agreement with our ab initio benchmark is obtained by representatives from each of the three categories of functionals, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid DFT, with mean absolute errors in, for example, central barriers of 4.3 (OPBE), 2.2 (M06-L), and 2.0 kcal/mol (M06), respectively. Importantly, the hybrid functional BHandH and the meta-GGA M06-L yield incorrect trends and qualitative features of the PESs (in particular, an erroneous preference for SN2 over the anti-E2 in the case of F− + CH3CH2F) even though they are among the best functionals as measured by their small mean absolute errors of 3.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol in reaction barriers. OLYP and B3LYP have somewhat higher mean absolute errors in central barriers (5.6 and 4.8 kcal/mol, respectively), but the error distribution is somewhat more uniform, and as a consequence, the correct trends are reproduced.},

  abstract  = {Abstract To obtain a set of consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PES) for the two archetypal nucleophilic substitution reactions of the chloride anion at carbon in chloromethane (SN2@C) and at silicon in chlorosilane (SN2@Si), we have explored these PESes using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [HF, MP2, MP4SDQ, CCSD, CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of six Gaussian-type basis sets, up to g polarization. Relative energies of stationary points are converged to within 0.01 to 0.56 kcal/mol as a function of the basis-set size. Our best estimate, at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ, for the relative energies of the [Cl?, CH3Cl] reactant complex, the [Cl?CH3?Cl]? transition state and the stable [Cl?SiH3?Cl]? transition complex is ?10.42, +2.52, and ?27.10 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, we have investigated the performance for these reactions of four popular density functionals, namely, BP86, BLYP, B3LYP, and OLYP, in combination with a large doubly polarized Slater-type basis set of triple-? quality (TZ2P). Best overall agreement with our CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ benchmark is obtained with OLYP and B3LYP. However, OLYP performs better for the SN2@C overall and central barriers, which it underestimates by 2.65 and 4.05 kcal/mol, respectively. The other DFT approaches underestimate these barriers by some 4.8 (B3LYP) to 9.0 kcal/mol (BLYP). ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 26: 1497?1504, 2005},

The focus is comparison of computed and experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition, the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the 622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation are 3.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 kcal/mol for B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction. A diverse set of 34 isomerizations highlights specific issues of general interest, such as performance on differences in steric effects, conjugation, and bonding. The corresponding MAEs for the isomerizations are 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol. Improvement is obtained for isomerizations of amines and alcohols when both polarization and diffuse functions are used, but the overstabilization of linear alkanes compared to branched isomers can be relieved only with the dispersion correction. Besides the insights on DFT methods, the study also aimed to quantify the gains in accuracy that can be achieved by replacing energetics from NDO-based semiempirical methods with DFT results. Since the MAEs obtained with the PDDG/PM3 method for the 622 heats of formation and 34 isomerizations are 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, negligible advantage in accuracy for the B3LYP-based methods emerged in the absence of the dispersion corrections.},

Nanocelluloses in particular show great promise as a cost-effective advanced material for biomedical applications because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cytotoxicity. Moreover, with their chemical functionality they can be easily modified to yield useful products. While nature uses the hierarchical nanostructure of cellulose as the load-bearing constituent in plants, a significant amount of research has been directed toward the fabrication of advanced cellulosic materials with various nanostructures and functional properties. Such nanocelluloses are widely applied in medical implants, tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound healing, diagnostics, and other medical applications with real examples in this field. There are also emerging fields being developed to use nanocelluloses and their composites in more novel ways in biomedical applications such as 3D printing and magnetically responsive materials. In this mini-review, recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanocellulose-based materials and composites are presented with a special emphasis on their suitability for material requirements for biomedical applications as well as the new directions and challenges that the materials might face in the future.},

  abstract  = {Conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels is partly inefficient due to the deleterious impact of cellulose crystallinity on enzymatic saccharification. We demonstrate how the synergistic activity of cellulases was enhanced by altering the hydrogen bond network within crystalline cellulose fibrils. We provide a molecular-scale explanation of these phenomena through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enzymatic assays. Ammonia transformed the naturally occurring crystalline allomorph I$\beta$ to IIII, which led to a decrease in the number of cellulose intrasheet hydrogen bonds and an increase in the number of intersheet hydrogen bonds. This rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within cellulose IIII, which increased the number of solvent-exposed glucan chain hydrogen bonds with water by ∼50%, was accompanied by enhanced saccharification rates by up to 5-fold (closest to amorphous cellulose) and 60-70% lower maximum surface-bound cellulase capacity. The enhancement in apparent cellulase activity was attributed to the “amorphous-like” nature of the cellulose IIII fibril surface that facilitated easier glucan chain extraction. Unrestricted substrate accessibility to active-site clefts of certain endocellulase families further accelerated deconstruction of cellulose IIII. Structural and dynamical features of cellulose IIII, revealed by MD simulations, gave additional insights into the role of cellulose crystal structure on fibril surface hydration that influences interfacial enzyme binding. Subtle alterations within the cellulose hydrogen bond network provide an attractive way to enhance its deconstruction and offer unique insight into the nature of cellulose recalcitrance. This approach can lead to unconventional pathways for development of novel pretreatments and engineered cellulases for cost-effective biofuels production.},

Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3 → C6 → C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

  abstract = {Twenty-six monohydrates of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-d-glucopyranose were studied using gradient methods at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory. Geometry optimization was carried out with the water molecules at different configurations around the glucose molecule. A new nomenclature for hydrated carbohydrates was developed to describe the water configurations. Zero-point vibrational energy, enthalpy, entropy, and relative free energy were obtained using the harmonic approximation. Hydrogen-bond energies for the monohydrates range from ∼−5 to −12kcal/mol, and the average relative free energy is ∼5kcal/mol. The 1-hydroxy position is the most energetically favored site for hydration, and the region between the two and three positions is the next-most favored site. A water molecule approaching $\alpha$-d-glucose between the 1- and 2-hydroxy positions pulls the 2-hydroxyl hydrogen atom away from the 1-hydroxy oxygen atom, thus increasing the hydrogen-bond length and also increasing the $\alpha$-d-glucose energy. The increase in energy that occurs with a similar interaction on the $\beta$-anomer is much less effective since the hydrogen bond is much longer. Using the calculated free energies of all 26 configurations, the anomer population ($\alpha$/$\beta$) increases in the $\beta$-anomer population relative to the in vacuo case by ∼10% at the expense of the $\alpha$-anomer, giving an ($\alpha$/$\beta$) ratio of ∼50/50. This result arises from entropy contributions favoring the $\beta$-anomer more than the $\alpha$-anomer. From analysis of donor and acceptor hydrogen-bond lengths, excellent correlation is found between the DFT calculated distances and those taken from carbohydrate structures in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Bank.},

The basis set superposition error is corrected by means of the counterpoise scheme and based on the ?chemical Hamiltonian approach.? The counterpoise and CHA-corrected DFT curves are generally close to each other. Using small basis sets, the B3LYP functional cannot be favored against the BLYP one because the BLYP results sometimes get closer to the MP2 values than those of B3LYP. From the results?including the available literature data?we suggest that one has to use at least polarized-valence triple-zeta-quality basis sets (TZV, 6-311G) for the investigation of hydrogen-bonded complexes. Special attention must be paid to the physical nature of the binding. If the dispersion forces become significant DFT methods are not able to describe the interaction. Proper correction for the basis set superposition error is found to be mandatory in all cases.?? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.?J Comput Chem 19: 575?584, 1998},

The error is systematic and cumulative, such that the reaction energies of reactions involving hydrocarbons with more than 4−6 C−C bonds are predicted quite poorly. Energies are underestimated for slightly and highly methyl-substituted cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons, so the errors do not arise from structural issues such as steric repulsion or ring strain energy. We trace the error associated with the B3LYP approach to its consistent underestimation of the C−C bond energy. Other DFT models show this problem to lesser extents, while the MP2 method avoids it. As a consequence, we discourage the use of the B3LYP model for reaction energy calculations for organic compounds containing more than four carbon atoms. We advocate use of a collection of pure and hybrid DFT models (and ab initio models where possible) to provide computational “error bars”.},

Yet, these dimers are thermally very stable even at temperatures above 200 °C, which is not in line with common C-C bond length versus bond strengths correlations. We suggest that the extraordinary stabilization arises from numerous intramolecular van der Waals attractions between the neighboring H-terminated diamond-like surfaces. The C-C bond rotational dynamics of 1-(1-adamantyl)diamantane, 1-(1-diamantyl)diamantane, 2-(1-adamantyl)triamantane, 2-(1-diamantyl)triamantane, and 2-(1-diamantyl)[121]tetramantane were studied through variable-temperature 1H- and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The shapes of the inward (endo) CH surfaces determine the dynamic behavior, changing the central C-C bond rotation barriers from 7 to 33 kcal mol-1. We probe the ability of popular density functional theory (DFT) approaches (including BLYP, B3LYP, B98, B3LYP-Dn, B97D, B3PW91, BHandHLYP, B3P86, PBE1PBE, wB97XD, and M06-2X) with 6-31G(d,p) and cc-pVDZ basis sets to describe such an unusual bonding situation. Only functionals accounting for dispersion are able to reproduce the experimental geometries, while most DFT functionals are able to reproduce the experimental rotational barriers due to error cancellations. Computations on larger diamondoids reveal that the interplay between the shapes and the sizes of the CH surfaces may even allow the preparation of open-shell alkyl radical dimers (and possibly polymers) that are strongly held together exclusively by dispersion forces.},

Minimum-energy structures of three neutral and six protonated species for each anomer were calculated. Geometries, energies, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these structures are discussed. For the neutral species at 298 K the order of stability for the hydroxymethyl conformers is calculated to be GT > GG > TG for the $\alpha$ anomer and GG > GT > TG for the $\beta$ anomer. Protonated species that least disrupt the internal hydrogen bonding network in the neutral species are considered; these include protonations on the oxygen sites labeled as the hydroxymethyl O6, the ring O5, and the exocylic hydroxyl O4. The O6 protonation in the TG conformation is electronically most favored. Energy corrections for basis-set deficiency and electron-correlation omission in the adopted theoretical procedure were estimated from high-level calculations on ethanol, 2-propanol, and dimethyl ether. In addition, the gas-phase basicity (GB) of glucose was measured by proton transfer reactions in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The experimental GB values for both anomers were determined to be 188 ± 3 kcal/mol. The experimental values are compared with the ab initio estimates of 178−190 and 177−189 kcal/mol for the respective $\alpha$ and $\beta$ anomers. Theoretical structures for the lowest-electronic-energy protonated species in the three hydroxymethyl conformations of each anomer are also presented to serve as reference data for postulating various kinetic pathways.},

The reaction barrier for the proton-catalyzed glucose condensation reaction is solvent induced because of proton’s high affinity for water.

Geometries of reactant complexes, transition states, intermediates, and completely denitrated product were optimized at the density functional theory (DFT) level using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution.

Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were also performed to validate the computed transition state structures. Effect of electron correlation on computed energies was considered through a single point energy calculation at the MP2 level using the cc-pVTZ basis set. It was revealed that the presence of hydrogen bonds between the attacking OH- ion and various hydrogen bond donating sites (including CH sites) of monomer was necessary for stabilization of the transition state.

Experimental findings revealed that the most important fire properties such as ignition time, mass loss rate and ash content exhibited significant differences between the two structures of NC. Compared with the soft fiber NC, chip NC possesses a lower fire hazard, and its heat release rate intensity (HRRI) is mainly affected by the sample mass. In addition, oxygen consumption (OC) calorimetry method was compared with thermal chemistry (TC) method based on stoichiometry for HRRI calculation. HRRI results of NC with two structures obtained by these two methods showed a good consistency.},

  abstract    = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a relatively sensitive explosive used in many electroexplosive devices as well as in medicine. Of primary interest to LLNL is its use in items such as exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators and exploding bridge foil initiators (EFI). In these devices the crystalline powder is pressed into a granular, low-density compact that can be initiated by an exploding wire or foil. The long-term stability of this pressed compact is of interest to weapon stockpile lifetime prediction studies. Key points about potential aging mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1) There are a number of factors that can contribute to PETN instability. These include particle size, polymorphic phase transitions, crystal structure, impurities, moisture, occlusions, chemical incompatibility and biological (microorganism) action. of these factors the most important for long-term aging of high surface area powders used in detonators appears to be that of particle size growth. (2) There is a great deal of literature on the thermal degradation kinetics of PETN, unfortunately much of it with little bearing on ambient temperature aging during long-term storage. PETN is very stable with respect to thermal decomposition. Low-temperature thermal studies have not revealed evidence of chemical degradation products in archived PETN. Data extrapolated to 30 C predicts a half-life of 12 million years. (3) Moisture seems to lower the activation energy for and accelerate the decomposition of PETN. (4) External drivers affecting stability include temperature, moisture, radiation fields, and stress, while internal drivers include residual solvents, and impurities. Temperature affects kinetic processes of crystal growth such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion rates of molecules on the surface of PETN crystals. A low-level radiation field may induce unexpected changes in the chemical makeup of PETN and its homologue impurities. Stress at high pressure points caused by crystalline surface irregularities may cause a decrease in surface area over time due to smoothing of contact points and sintering. PETN has been found to contain a number of impurities, including homologues, pentaerythryl ethers with a mixture of hydroxyl and nitrate functional groups, and organic salts, that can alter its physical and chemical properties. (5) The processes of sublimation/recrystallization and surface diffusion are important processes that can cause changes in PETN crystal morphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area. Sublimation feeds a process called Ostwald ripening, which involves the spontaneous growth of larger crystals from those of smaller size. This process proceeds with age regardless of storage conditions unless the crystals are treated to retard growth. The coarsening mechanisms include Ostwald ripening, 'sintering', and surface diffusion. The latter has not been experimentally observed, but a molecular modeling approach has attempted to investigate this phenomenon theoretically. (6) Threshold test fire, particle size distribution, specific surface area, thermal analysis, chemical analysis, powder compact specific surface area and density are approaches that have been used in the attempt to assess changes attributable to aging of PETN, with varying results. The biggest problem lies in the aging mechanism itself, which likely influences small changes in morphology, both internal and external, and particle size distribution changes on a scale too small to reliably monitor. Other aspects, such as subtle changes in density profiles within pressed powder compacts, may be beyond the capability of current technology to assess. Crystal growth significant enough to affect the PETN particle size distribution is expected to impact detonator performance. (7) Factors relevant to stabilizing particle size growth include crystal morphology, powder surface area and particle size distribution; crystal density and internal defects; and powder compact density and density gradients.},

  abstract    = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is used throughout the stockpile as an energetic material. The formulation of PETN into XTX8003 (80% PETN, 20% Sylgard 182) creates an extrudable energetic composite. PETN and XTX8003 are used in the firesets for the retired W68 (MC2370) and the W76 (MC3028). When faced with potential lifetime extensions, energetic materials are naturally suspect regarding their output after prolonged aging. The authors have studied PETN and XTX8003 by looking at 25-year-old samples from retired MC2370s and newer materials. Both the old and new materials have also been placed in various accelerated aging protocols to investigate any decomposition that might occur over time. PETN is known to decompose autocatalytically even in the early stages of decomposition, but the process is poorly understood. Published values for the activation energy of decomposition vary by >40 kcal/mol. The 12 million year half life predicted for room temperature PETN would be dramatically shortened by chemical influences that lead to lower energy decomposition pathways. Degree of confinement, purity, and crystal size all influence degradation rates. In this paper, the authors observe the effects of chemical and thermal aging on PETN. They anticipate changes in mechanism at higher temperature aging, and before trying to extrapolate to lower temperatures, they want to make sure that they understand the different chemical processed involved.},

Decomposition was more rapid as the temperature was raised and attained a maximum rate between 65?75% HNO3. Spent nitrating acids decomposed more rapidly than pure acids with PETN, due to the presence of about 0.5% dipentaerythrital hexanitrate (DiPEHN) formed from dipentaerythritol in the original PE. The decomposition of PETN in nitric acids was strongly catalysed by NO2, especially at high acid strength. The course of the decomposition as deduced from this evidence appeared to embrace (1) hydrolysis, (2) oxidation of hydrolysis products liberating NO2, (3) destruction of PETN by a mechanism catalysed by NO2 in which hydrolysis plays no part.},

We report here about a reaction where DPA bonds to nitrocellulose, leaving a non extractable aromatic stabilizing compound left in the propellant, resulting in a longer time to autocatalysis than predicted. Diphenylnitramine is discussed as a possible intermediary compound occurring from the reaction between DPA and nitrocellulose. This should add to a better understanding of the degradation processes in propellants.},

However, the few papers that focused on the determination of nitrocellulose used in explosives employed analytical techniques [e.g., vibrational techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy), MS and ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and liquid chromatography (LC) (high-performance LC and ion chromatography)]. Most of the information reported by these techniques has been qualitative. Only quantitative determination of nitrocellulose or its nitrogen content has been performed by measuring the nitrite and/or nitrate ions released from its basic hydrolysis.},

This study sheds much needed light on the atomic decomposition mechanisms of nitroesters with an example of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (C5H8N4O12, also known as PETN), used as an explosive and a medication. The performed study is based on density functional theory combined with variational transition-state theory and large-scale massively parallel periodic supercell calculations and presents a detailed analysis of thermal initiation of chemical reactions and their kinetics in the gas-phase PETN molecules, the ideal bulk crystals, and on two low energy surfaces, (101) and (110). The obtained activation barriers, reaction energies, and reaction rates of simulated bond dissociation mechanisms reveal that the overall decomposition of condensed nitroesters is defined by the interplay of two major reactions, the fast endothermic O-NO2 homolysis and the slow exothermic HONO elimination. While the O-N cleavage has a low activation barrier and essentially initiates the degradation of the material, the HONO elimination pathway serves to accelerate the global process by generating heat to support the reaction. This trend is suggested to be general for a large class of traditional and novel nitroesters.},

  abstract = {A non-destructive UV-Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO-NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV-Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time’ plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO-NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO-NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO-NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO-NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 > C2 > C3.},

This adaptation has made it possible to make real-time measurements on the decomposition of nitrocellulose (NC) and PBX 9404 at realistic storage temperatures for these materials.

NOx (= NO + NO2) evolution in NC decomposition occurs with a k(T) of (1.9 ÷× 2) × 107exp [(−12800 ± 300)T] s−1 below 350°K, while above 370°K k(T) = (4.3 ÷× 4) × 1017exp [(−21500 ± 750)T] s−1, both per submole (molecular weight 264) NC. Prior T ≥ 370°K exposure of NC leads to increased evolution rates at ≤ 350°K because of the desorption of the NOx, which was adsorbed at the higher temperature. NO2 is shown to be the primary NC decomposition product and is rapidly reduced to NO. PBX 9404 results are compared to NC results and it is shown that diphenylamine, present in PBX 9404, catalyzes NC decomposition and also reduced NO2 to NO.},

It was found that protonation of the C2-OH on glucose, the breakage of the C2-O2 bond, and the formation of the C2-O5 bond is the critical rate-limiting step for the direct glucose conversion to HMF without converting to fructose first, contrary to the wide-spread assumption in literature that fructose is the main intermediate for glucose conversion to HMF.

  abstract  = {The mechanism of neutral hydrolysis of ester has long been explored by theoretical studies. However, reliable theoretical calculations show that the usual bifunctional catalysis mechanism reported by different authors cannot explain the experimental kinetics. An important advance was recently reported by Gunaydin and Houk, suggesting that ions are involved in the mechanism and the process initiates by water autoionization followed by protonation of the ester (WAIA mechanism). However, this mechanism does not explain the hydrolysis of activated esters. In this work, we have used ab initio calculations, continuum solvation models, and intrinsic reaction coordinate method to support the WAIA mechanism for normal ester. In the case of activated esters, the process can also be viewed as water autoionization with formation of hydroxide ion aided by a second water molecule acting as a general base (WAIB mechanism). This is the mechanism that was proposed by Jencks and Carriuolo 50 years ago. Our analysis point out that the usual method for exploring mechanisms, searching for saddle points, may not work for problems like the present one, since there are no saddle points on the reaction pathway. Rather, the formation of a pair of ions from a neutral species may have an asymptotic barrier. The approach used in this paper allows the calculation of the free energy profile and enable us to explain the mechanism and kinetics of the neutral hydrolysis of normal (methyl acetate) and activated (methyl trifluoroacetate) esters. In addition, the present study suggests that formation of a pair of ions should always be considered in reactions in aqueous solution.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The free-energy profile for the different reaction pathways available to the hydroxide ion and methyl formate in aqueous solution is reported for the first time. The theoretical analysis was carried out by using the cluster-continuum method recently proposed by us for calculating the free energy of solvation of ions. Unlike the gas-phase reaction, our results are consistent with the fact that the reaction occurs mainly by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide on the carbonyl carbon to yield a tetrahedral intermediate (BAC2 mechanism). However, an additional pathway, in which the hydroxide ion acts as a general base and a water molecule coordinated to this ion acts as the nucleophile, is also predicted to be important. The relative importance of these pathways is calculated to be 87?% and 13?%, respectively. The tetrahedral intermediate of the hydrolysis reaction has an estimated lifetime of 10 nanoseconds, and its conjugate acid has a pKa of 8.8. This tetrahedral intermediate is predicted to proceed to products by two pathways: elimination of methoxide ion (84?%) and by water catalyzed elimination of methanol (16?%). The less common reaction pathway, which involves attack of the hydroxide ion on the formyl hydrogen (decarbonylation mechanism) and leads to water, carbon monoxide, and methanol, is calculated to be only 3 kcal?mol?1 less favorable than the BAC2 mechanism. By comparison, direct attack of the hydroxide ion on the methyl group (BAL2 or SN2 mechanism) leading to an acyl-oxygen bond cleavage has a very high free energy of activation and is not expected to be important. The theoretically observed activation free energy at 298.15 K is calculated to be 15.5 kcal?mol?1, in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured value of 15.3 kcal?mol?1. This present model allows for a clear distinction between contributions due to solvation and those due to intrinsic (gas-phase) effects and proves to yield results in very good agreement with available experimental data.},

  abstract = {The use of inorganic stabilizers for double-base propellants in literature is scanty; therefore five samples (S1-S5) of different percentages (2-4%) of nano-clinoptilolite were investigated as new inorganic stabilizers for double-base propellants (DBPs). The grain size of clinoptilolite stabilizer played an important role in the stabilization effect. As the grain size of stabilizer decreases, the surface area of stabilizer increases and the ability to absorb pronounce amount of hazardous nitrogen oxides increases. In this work clinoptilolite in nano-scale (30nm) has been used to obtain higher stabilizing effect for DBPs. The evaluation process has been performed through the classical thermal stability tests (Bergmann-Junk and calorimetric tests), in comparison with thermal analyses measurements (TGA and DSC) and kinetic parameters calculation such as activation energy (Ea), enthalpy of activation (ΔH*), Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG*), entropy of activation (ΔS*) and frequency factor (A), which calculated using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The results for the new stabilizers were compared with that for the classical one (N,N-diethyldiphenyl urea, C1). It has been found that the samples containing new stabilizer with percentages (3.0, 3.5 and 4.0%) showed better stability effect for DBPs than the classical one. The efficiency of stabilization of each inorganic stabilizer to DBPs is also rationalized and correlated with its structure.},

  abstract = {Aliphatic nitrate esters are currently the most widely used energetic ingredients in single-, double-, and triple-base propellants. These nitrate esters are unstable at ambient conditions, and stabilizing agents should be incorporated into the energetic compositions to inhibit and slow down the decomposition reactions that can occur. However, the currently used stabilizers present a number of environmental and human health issues. To overcome these shortcomings, many stabilizers have been appeared in the past few decades and continue to be developed. Furthermore, several analytical techniques have been introduced to monitor the stability of nitrate ester-based energetic materials as well, since the existing ones could not be efficiently applied. Therefore, this review paper discusses and summarizes the current and emergent stabilizers as well as their mechanisms of action. A critical and analytical examination of their advantages and drawbacks is made.},

  abstract = {The granules containing nitrogen of various content (12.2-13.3%) and stabilizers (centralite I, centralite II, akardite II, triphenylamine) were obtained in laboratory scale, and the study of their physicochemical and thermal properties was conducted. It has been observed that the helium density of granules depends on the degree of gelling of nitrocellulose by the stabilizer as well as the lack of effect of the stabilizer type on the heat of combustion value. In turn, the heat of combustion depends on the content of nitrogen in nitrocellulose. Granules of 13.3% N nitrocellulose were characterized by a more rapidly developing thermal decomposition than the granules containing 12.2 and 12.9% N nitrocellulose. The maximum temperature of decomposition shifts toward higher temperatures (from 207.6 to 209.8 °C) with decreasing nitrogen content in nitrocellulose for granules containing triphenylamine as a stabilizer. All values of heat generation rate obtained for granules with triphenylamine were lower than the respective rates for granules with centralite I. Thermal properties and chemical stability of granules containing triphenylamine have better properties, when compared to other examined stabilizers. On the basis of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry, kinetic parameters were calculated by means of Ozawa-Flynn-Wall analysis. The effect of stabilizers and nitrogen content on kinetic parameters was determined. The kinetic model of thermal decomposition of granules was adjusted--the best fit was nth-order reaction with autocatalysis. The activation energy of thermal decomposition process according to the adopted chemical reaction model increases from 190 to 239 kJ mol−1 with increasing nitrogen content in the granulate.},
  comment  = {'During extended storage of the polymer, nitrogen oxide compounds can be emitted due to a low value of bond energy (155 kJ mol−1) of ester functional group –CH2O–NO2 [3, 4]. These nitrogen oxide compounds lead to destabilization of NC. In order to prevent this process from taking place, stabilizers for nitrocellulose products are introduced. These additives do not hinder decomposition process entirely and, however, may contribute to the reduction of autocatalytic effect of decomposition. Most stabilizers act based on the principle of chemical interactions, which include binding the products of decomposition [5, 6]. Derivatives of urea or aniline such as centralite, diphenylamine, akardite and 2-nitrodiphenylamine constitute the most commonly used stabilizers [6, 7]. Other stabilizers are investigated, as derivatives of urea and aniline produce carcinogenic nitrosamines by reaction with nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, diphenylamine (DPA) has toxic properties [3]. For this reason, new compounds are proposed as stabilizers for nitrocellulose, such as triphenylamine (TPA) [4], deprived of toxic properties. The reaction of this stabilizer with nitric oxides leads to the formation of nitro derivatives.'},

  abstract  = {“Flash Paper” is a nitrocellulose paper commonly used in magicians’ routines and accessible in magician supply stores. The intrinsic nitrate concentration determines its pyrotechnic characteristics, and this form of nitrocellulose is classified as an explosive (National Centre for Biotechnology Information 2009).

The fast disappearing Flash Paper can be used to give the illusion of throwing fire when lit by a hidden ignition source. Performed correctly, the stunt causes no injury to the magician, however, improper use of the material has the potential to cause serious injury, burning at a maximum temperature of approximately 209°C (He, et al. 2017; DeHaan 1975).

This is a case report of a thirteen year old admitted to a quaternary children’s hospital in Brisbane, Australia with burns sustained when a roll of Flash Paper ignited on his lap while experimenting with friends. Partial thickness burns were sustained involving bilateral medial thighs, the left side of the face and left pinna as well as mild conjunctival burns to his left eye. His treatment required an inpatient admission, ophthalmology treatment and outpatient burns dressings. Re-epithelialisation had occurred to the majority of his wounds including his conjunctival burn by Day 9. On follow up at Day 16, there was complete re-epithelialisation of all wounds.

Reports of Flash Paper burns have not to date been published. While the purchase of nitrocellulose products is restricted to persons over 18 years. Precautions must be taken in order to ensure the safety of novice magicians employing this easily obtainable form of nitrocellulose.

To eliminate the reactivity of nitro groups, the degradation of ethylcellulose was also investigated. Infrared spectroscopy analyses of the chemical modifications caused by the photooxidation of cellulose nitrate films and the resulting formation of volatile products revealed the occurrence of de-nitration and the formation of oxidation photoproducts exhibiting lactone and anhydride functions. The impact of these chemical modifications on the mechanical and thermal properties of cellulose nitrate films includes embrittlement and lower temperatures of ignition when used as a propellant.},

  abstract = {The oxidation of nitrocellulose (NC) containing 13.38% nitrogen has been investigated. The oxidation process under the action of hard UV radiation and ozone has been conducted for 27 h. As result, the nitrogen content of NC has decreased by less than 4.0%. For oxidation using Desulfovibrio (D.) desulfuricans sulfate-reducing bacteria, NC has been incubated with these bacteria for 65 days. This processing has reduced the nitrogen content of NC by 1.66���2.8%. D. desulfuricans incubation with NC pretreated with UV light + ozone has decreased the nitrogen content of the sample by at most 2.75% (compared to the baseline). UV + ozone pretreatment enables subsequent NC oxidation by D. desulfuricans: the resulting samples are richer in low-molecular-weight fractions and nitrate and nitro groups, and they reach their maximum extent of oxidation within 16 h of incubation with the bacteria, whereas the untreated samples oxidize to the maximum extent in 38 h. It is likely that the UV + ozone treatment cleaves carbon���carbon bonds in the polymer chain and lowers the degree of polymerization of individual chains, thereby facilitating the penetration of bacteria into the bulk polymer globules and the bacterial oxidation of ester bonds.},

The ability to characterize small differences in the crystalline structures of cellulose from fibers of different origins is thus highly important. In this work, dynamic FT-IR spectroscopy has been further explored as a method sensitive to cellulose structure variations. Using a model system of two different celluloses, the relation between spectral information and the relative cellulose I$\alpha$ content was investigated. This relation was then used to determine the relative cellulose I$\alpha$ content in different pulps. The estimated cellulose I allomorph compositions were found to be reasonable for both unbleached and bleached chemical pulps. In addition, it was found that the dynamic FT-IR spectroscopy technique had the potential to indicate possible correlation field splitting peaks of cellulose I$\alpha$.},

In addition, compounds including hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, methane, nitrogen oxides, benzene, acrylonitrile, toluene, furan, aromatic amines, benzopyrene, and various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are detected in minor concentrations. The literature shows that the thermodynamic prediction of the major decomposition products agrees fairly well with the measurements. However, poor agreement is found for the minor species. We have studied the thermal decomposition products of the main gunpowder ingredients. Each of the components nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine, and the nitrate ester stabilizers diphenylamine and ethyl centralite were thermally decomposed with ReaxFF reactive force field molecular dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics. The molecular dynamics results for the major decomposition products from nitrocellulose were partly consistent with measurements. Compared to the thermodynamic calculations, the molecular dynamics simulations agreed considerably better with experimental results for minor species like hydrogen cyanide. The nitrate ester stabilizers are the main sources for ammonia and aromatic combustion products, whereas hydrogen cyanide is produced from nitrocellulose as well as from the stabilizers when gunpowder is combusted.},

H.; Nimlos, M. R.; Davis, M.; Johnson, D. K.; Himmel, M. E. Carbohydr. Res.2005, 340, 2319-2327]. In addition, simulation results showed that water molecules could participate in the sugar reactions, thus altering the reaction pathways. In the present study, the temperature and water density effects on the sugar degradation pathways were investigated with CPMD. We found that changes in both temperature and water density could profoundly affect the mechanisms and pathways. We attributed these effects to both the strength of hydrogen bonding and proton affinity of water.},

  abstract = {Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate, with explicit solvent water molecules, $\beta$-d-glucose and $\beta$-d-xylose degradation mechanisms in acidic media. The rate-limiting step in sugar degradation was found to be protonation of the hydroxyl groups on the sugar ring. We found that the structure of water molecules plays a significant role in the acidic sugar degradation pathways. Firstly, a water molecule competes with the hydroxyl group on the sugar ring for protons. Secondly, water forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the sugar rings, thus weakening the C-C and C-O bonds (each to a different degree). Note that the reaction pathways could be altered due to the change of relative stability of the C-C and C-O bonds. Thirdly, water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded to sugar hydroxyls could easily extract a proton from the reaction intermediate, terminating the reaction. Indeed, the sugar degradation pathway is complex due to multiple protonation probabilities and the surrounding water structure. Our experimental data support multiple sugar acidic degradation pathways.},

In the case of xylose, a 2,5-anhydride intermediate was observed leading to the formation of furfural through elimination of water. This pathway agrees with one of the mechanisms proposed in the literature in that no open chain intermediates were found. In the case of glucose, a series of intermediates were observed before forming the 2,5-anhydride intermediate that eventually leads to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). One of these intermediates was a very short-lived open-chain form. Furthermore, two novel side-reaction pathways were identified, which lead to degradation products other than HMF.},

The study included parameterisation of force fields for nitrocellulose; 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane; the stabilizer ethyl centralite; and the overall nitrocellulose binder mixtures. Simulated densities obtained were in very good agreement with experimental densities. The diffusion coefficients compare favourably with experimental values available for similar systems, when differences such as the proportions of plasticisers are taken into consideration. Examination of the plasticiser diffusion rates suggests that 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane migrates more slowly from a nitrocellulose binder than 2,4-dinitroethylbenzene for the nitrocellulose and plasticiser proportions used in this study. Understanding plasticiser migration is essential for the long-term storage of energetic material formulations without significant changes occurring in their properties or compositions.},

Molecular dynamics simulations of the acid molecule and 200 water molecules were propagated for several nanoseconds, and the resulting structures were used as input to QM/MM geometry optimization runs. Approximately 20-30 water molecules were included along with the acid in the QM portion of the calculation, which was carried out at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level. Whereas dissociation to ions is always spontaneous in the bulk, we find that acid molecules confined to the water surface dissociate only with the participation of two additional water molecules, forming a critical cluster about the solute. Thus acid dissociation may occur in the near-surface zone at a dynamic air-water interface, in agreement with our earlier experimental conclusions [Clifford et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.. 2007, 9, 1362].},
