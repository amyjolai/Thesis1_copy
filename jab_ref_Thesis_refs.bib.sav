  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the extension of the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) to a much broader range of organic systems. It also describes a preliminary parameterization of MMFF94 for the hydronium and hydroxide ions and for various halide, alkalai, and alkalai earth ions as well as for such “protein” metals as Zn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Cu+, Fe2+, and Fe3+. The extension employed computational data on charge distributions, molecular geometries, and conformational energies for a series of oxysulfur (particularly sulfonamide) and oxyphosphorous compounds and for a diverse set of small molecules and ions not covered in the core parameterization. It also employed experimental data for approximately 2800 good-quality structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Some of the additional computational data were used to extend the explicit parameterization of electrostatic interactions and to more widely define a useful additive approximation for the “bond polarity” parameters (bond charge increments) used in MMFF94. Both the experimental and computational data served to define reference bond lengths and angles that the extended force field uses in conjunction with force constants obtained from carefully calibrated empirical rules. The extended torsion parameters consist partly of explicit parameters derived to reproduce MP2/6-31G* conformational energies and partly of “default parameters” provided by empirical rules patterned after those used in DREIDING and UFF but calibrated, where possible, against computationally derived MMFF94 torsion parameters. Comparisons to experimental data show that MMFF94 reproduces crystallographic bond lengths and bond angles with relatively modest root mean square (rms) deviations of approx. 0.02 Å and 2°, respectively. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for conformational energies, rotational barriers, and equilibrium torsion angles. It describes the derivation of the torsion parameters from high-quality computational data and characterizes MMFF94's ability to reproduce both computational and experimental data, the latter particularly in relation to MM3. The computational data included: (i)  250 comparisons of conformational energy based on “MP4SDQ/TZP” calculations (triple-zeta plus polarization calculations at a defined approximation to the highly correlated MP4SDQ level) at MP2/6-31G* geometries; and (ii)  1200 MP2/TZP comparisons of “torsion profile” structures at geometries derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries. The torsion parameters were derived in restrained least-squares fits that used the complete set of available computational data, thereby ensuring that a fully optimal set of parameters would be obtained. The final parameters reproduce the “MP4SDQ/TZP” and MP2/TZP computational data with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.31 and 0.50 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces a set of 37 experimental gas-phase and solution conformational energies, enthalpies, and free energies with a rms deviation of 0.38 kcal/mol; for comparison, the “MP4SDQ/TZP” calculations and MM3 each gives a rms deviation of 0.37 kcal/mol. Furthermore, MMFF94 reproduces 28 experimentally determined rotational barriers with a rms deviation of 0.39 kcal/mol. Given the diverse nature of the experimental conformational energies and rotational barriers and the clear indications of experimental error in some cases, the MMFF94 results appear excellent. Nevertheless, MMFF94 encounters somewhat greater difficulty in handling multifunctional compounds that place highly polar functional groups in close proximity, probably because it, like other commonly used force fields, too greatly simplifies the description of electrostatic interactions. Some suggestions for enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are discussed. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article defines the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for intermolecular interactions. It specifies the novel “buffered” functional forms used for treating van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interactions, and describes the use of : (1) high quality ab initio data to parameterize vdW interactions involving aliphatic hydrogens; and (2) HF/6-31G* calculations on hydrogen-bonded complexes to parameterize nonbonded interactions in polar systems. Comparisons show that appropriate trends in the HF/6-31G* data are well reproduced by MMFF94 and that intermolecular interaction energies and geometries closely parallel those given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. A proper balance between solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute interactions, critically important for prospective success in aqueous simulations, thus appears to be attained. Comparison of MMFF94, OPLS, CHELPG electrostatic potential fit, QEq, Gasteiger, and Abraham charges for 20 small molecules and ions also shows the close correspondence between MMFF94 and OPLS. As do OPLS and all current, widely used force fields, MMFF94 employs “effective pair potentials” which incorporate in an averaged way the increases in polarity which occur in high dielectric media. Some limitations of this approach are discussed and suggestions for possible enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are noted. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for molecular geometries and deformations. It defines the form used for the valence-coordinate terms that represent variations in bond lengths and angles, and it describes the derivation of quadratic force constants from HF/6-31G* data and the derivation of reference bond lengths and angles from fits to MP2/6-31G*-optimized geometries. Comparisons offered show that MMFF94 accurately reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization and demonstrate that its derivation from such data simultaneously confers the ability to reproduce experiment. In particular, MMFF94 reproduces experimentally determined bond lengths and angles for 30 organic molecules with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.014 Å and 1.2°, respectively. MM3 reproduces bond angles to the same accuracy, but reproduces experimental bond lengths more accurately, in part because it was fit directly to thermally averaged experimental bond lengths; MMFF94, in contrast, was fit to (usually shorter) energy-minimum values, as is proper for an anharmonic force field intended for use in molecular-dynamics simulations. The comparisons also show that UFF and a recent version of CHARMm (QUANTA 3.3 parameterization) are less accurate for molecular geometries than either MMFF94 or MM3. For vibrational frequencies, MMFF94 and MM3 give comparable overall rms deviations versus experiment of 61 cm−1 and 57 cm−1, respectively, for 15 small, mostly organic molecules. In a number of instances, MM3's derivation employed observed frequencies that differ substantially—by nearly 400 cm−1 in one case—from other published frequencies which had themselves been confirmed theoretically by good-quality ab initio calculations. Overall, the comparisons to experimental geometries and vibrational frequencies demonstrate that MMFF94 achieves MM3-like accuracy for organic systems for which MM3 has been parameterized. Because MMFF94 is derived mainly from computational data, however, it has been possible to parameterize MMFF94 with equal rigor for a wide variety of additional systems for which little or no useful experimental data exist. Equally good performance can be expected for such systems. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Both the direct and angular attacks of OH− in the hydrolysis reactions were considered. Geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level both in the gas phase and in bulk water solution. Effect of bulk water solution was modeled using the PCM approach. Nature of potential energy surfaces of the local minima and transition states was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were also performed to validate the computed transition state structures. Effect of electron correlation on computed energies was considered at the MP2/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. It was found that the angular attack of OH− in the hydrolysis reaction will require significantly larger activation energy than the direct attack. Computed transition states correspond to the structure where the presence of hydrogen bonds between the OH− and various sites of nitrocellulose was the necessary stabilizing factor. The ring breaking through the C-O ring bond was not found to be the first step in the alkaline hydrolysis reactions. It was predicted that alkaline hydrolysis would be driven by the addition-elimination (substitution) reaction starting at the C3 site and will progress in the C2 $\rightarrow$ C6 direction. Entropy of system in water solution will have profound effect on alkaline hydrolysis reaction of nitrocellulose.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Multiwfn is a multifunctional program for wavefunction analysis. Its main functions are: (1) Calculating and visualizing real space function, such as electrostatic potential and electron localization function at point, in a line, in a plane or in a spatial scope. (2) Population analysis. (3) Bond order analysis. (4) Orbital composition analysis. (5) Plot density-of-states and spectrum. (6) Topology analysis for electron density. Some other useful utilities involved in quantum chemistry studies are also provided. The built-in graph module enables the results of wavefunction analysis to be plotted directly or exported to high-quality graphic file. The program interface is very user-friendly and suitable for both research and teaching purpose. The code of Multiwfn is substantially optimized and parallelized. Its efficiency is demonstrated to be significantly higher than related programs with the same functions. Five practical examples involving a wide variety of systems and analysis methods are given to illustrate the usefulness of Multiwfn. The program is free of charge and open-source.

  abstract  = {We have computed consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the anti-E2, syn-E2, and SN2 pathways of X− + CH3CH2X with X = F and Cl. This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). The ab initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) < SN2 (X = F) < SN2 (X = Cl)  syn-E2 (X = F) < anti-E2 (X = Cl) < syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F− + CH3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl− + CH3CH2Cl, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway. Best overall agreement with our ab initio benchmark is obtained by representatives from each of the three categories of functionals, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid DFT, with mean absolute errors in, for example, central barriers of 4.3 (OPBE), 2.2 (M06-L), and 2.0 kcal/mol (M06), respectively. Importantly, the hybrid functional BHandH and the meta-GGA M06-L yield incorrect trends and qualitative features of the PESs (in particular, an erroneous preference for SN2 over the anti-E2 in the case of F− + CH3CH2F) even though they are among the best functionals as measured by their small mean absolute errors of 3.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol in reaction barriers. OLYP and B3LYP have somewhat higher mean absolute errors in central barriers (5.6 and 4.8 kcal/mol, respectively), but the error distribution is somewhat more uniform, and as a consequence, the correct trends are reproduced.},

  abstract  = {Abstract To obtain a set of consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PES) for the two archetypal nucleophilic substitution reactions of the chloride anion at carbon in chloromethane (SN2@C) and at silicon in chlorosilane (SN2@Si), we have explored these PESes using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [HF, MP2, MP4SDQ, CCSD, CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of six Gaussian-type basis sets, up to g polarization. Relative energies of stationary points are converged to within 0.01 to 0.56 kcal/mol as a function of the basis-set size. Our best estimate, at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ, for the relative energies of the [Cl?, CH3Cl] reactant complex, the [Cl?CH3?Cl]? transition state and the stable [Cl?SiH3?Cl]? transition complex is ?10.42, +2.52, and ?27.10 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, we have investigated the performance for these reactions of four popular density functionals, namely, BP86, BLYP, B3LYP, and OLYP, in combination with a large doubly polarized Slater-type basis set of triple-? quality (TZ2P). Best overall agreement with our CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ benchmark is obtained with OLYP and B3LYP. However, OLYP performs better for the SN2@C overall and central barriers, which it underestimates by 2.65 and 4.05 kcal/mol, respectively. The other DFT approaches underestimate these barriers by some 4.8 (B3LYP) to 9.0 kcal/mol (BLYP). ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 26: 1497?1504, 2005},

The focus is comparison of computed and experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition, the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the 622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation are 3.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 kcal/mol for B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction. A diverse set of 34 isomerizations highlights specific issues of general interest, such as performance on differences in steric effects, conjugation, and bonding. The corresponding MAEs for the isomerizations are 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol. Improvement is obtained for isomerizations of amines and alcohols when both polarization and diffuse functions are used, but the overstabilization of linear alkanes compared to branched isomers can be relieved only with the dispersion correction. Besides the insights on DFT methods, the study also aimed to quantify the gains in accuracy that can be achieved by replacing energetics from NDO-based semiempirical methods with DFT results. Since the MAEs obtained with the PDDG/PM3 method for the 622 heats of formation and 34 isomerizations are 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, negligible advantage in accuracy for the B3LYP-based methods emerged in the absence of the dispersion corrections.},

Nanocelluloses in particular show great promise as a cost-effective advanced material for biomedical applications because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cytotoxicity. Moreover, with their chemical functionality they can be easily modified to yield useful products. While nature uses the hierarchical nanostructure of cellulose as the load-bearing constituent in plants, a significant amount of research has been directed toward the fabrication of advanced cellulosic materials with various nanostructures and functional properties. Such nanocelluloses are widely applied in medical implants, tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound healing, diagnostics, and other medical applications with real examples in this field. There are also emerging fields being developed to use nanocelluloses and their composites in more novel ways in biomedical applications such as 3D printing and magnetically responsive materials. In this mini-review, recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanocellulose-based materials and composites are presented with a special emphasis on their suitability for material requirements for biomedical applications as well as the new directions and challenges that the materials might face in the future.},

  abstract  = {Conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels is partly inefficient due to the deleterious impact of cellulose crystallinity on enzymatic saccharification. We demonstrate how the synergistic activity of cellulases was enhanced by altering the hydrogen bond network within crystalline cellulose fibrils. We provide a molecular-scale explanation of these phenomena through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enzymatic assays. Ammonia transformed the naturally occurring crystalline allomorph I$\beta$ to IIII, which led to a decrease in the number of cellulose intrasheet hydrogen bonds and an increase in the number of intersheet hydrogen bonds. This rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within cellulose IIII, which increased the number of solvent-exposed glucan chain hydrogen bonds with water by 50%, was accompanied by enhanced saccharification rates by up to 5-fold (closest to amorphous cellulose) and 60-70% lower maximum surface-bound cellulase capacity. The enhancement in apparent cellulase activity was attributed to the “amorphous-like” nature of the cellulose IIII fibril surface that facilitated easier glucan chain extraction. Unrestricted substrate accessibility to active-site clefts of certain endocellulase families further accelerated deconstruction of cellulose IIII. Structural and dynamical features of cellulose IIII, revealed by MD simulations, gave additional insights into the role of cellulose crystal structure on fibril surface hydration that influences interfacial enzyme binding. Subtle alterations within the cellulose hydrogen bond network provide an attractive way to enhance its deconstruction and offer unique insight into the nature of cellulose recalcitrance. This approach can lead to unconventional pathways for development of novel pretreatments and engineered cellulases for cost-effective biofuels production.},

Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3 $\rightarrow$ C6 $\rightarrow$ C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

  abstract = {Twenty-six monohydrates of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-d-glucopyranose were studied using gradient methods at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory. Geometry optimization was carried out with the water molecules at different configurations around the glucose molecule. A new nomenclature for hydrated carbohydrates was developed to describe the water configurations. Zero-point vibrational energy, enthalpy, entropy, and relative free energy were obtained using the harmonic approximation. Hydrogen-bond energies for the monohydrates range from −5 to −12kcal/mol, and the average relative free energy is 5kcal/mol. The 1-hydroxy position is the most energetically favored site for hydration, and the region between the two and three positions is the next-most favored site. A water molecule approaching $\alpha$-d-glucose between the 1- and 2-hydroxy positions pulls the 2-hydroxyl hydrogen atom away from the 1-hydroxy oxygen atom, thus increasing the hydrogen-bond length and also increasing the $\alpha$-d-glucose energy. The increase in energy that occurs with a similar interaction on the $\beta$-anomer is much less effective since the hydrogen bond is much longer. Using the calculated free energies of all 26 configurations, the anomer population ($\alpha$/$\beta$) increases in the $\beta$-anomer population relative to the in vacuo case by 10% at the expense of the $\alpha$-anomer, giving an ($\alpha$/$\beta$) ratio of 50/50. This result arises from entropy contributions favoring the $\beta$-anomer more than the $\alpha$-anomer. From analysis of donor and acceptor hydrogen-bond lengths, excellent correlation is found between the DFT calculated distances and those taken from carbohydrate structures in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Bank.},

The basis set superposition error is corrected by means of the counterpoise scheme and based on the ?chemical Hamiltonian approach.? The counterpoise and CHA-corrected DFT curves are generally close to each other. Using small basis sets, the B3LYP functional cannot be favored against the BLYP one because the BLYP results sometimes get closer to the MP2 values than those of B3LYP. From the results?including the available literature data?we suggest that one has to use at least polarized-valence triple-zeta-quality basis sets (TZV, 6-311G) for the investigation of hydrogen-bonded complexes. Special attention must be paid to the physical nature of the binding. If the dispersion forces become significant DFT methods are not able to describe the interaction. Proper correction for the basis set superposition error is found to be mandatory in all cases.?? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.?J Comput Chem 19: 575?584, 1998},

The error is systematic and cumulative, such that the reaction energies of reactions involving hydrocarbons with more than 4−6 C−C bonds are predicted quite poorly. Energies are underestimated for slightly and highly methyl-substituted cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons, so the errors do not arise from structural issues such as steric repulsion or ring strain energy. We trace the error associated with the B3LYP approach to its consistent underestimation of the C−C bond energy. Other DFT models show this problem to lesser extents, while the MP2 method avoids it. As a consequence, we discourage the use of the B3LYP model for reaction energy calculations for organic compounds containing more than four carbon atoms. We advocate use of a collection of pure and hybrid DFT models (and ab initio models where possible) to provide computational “error bars”.},

Yet, these dimers are thermally very stable even at temperatures above 200 °C, which is not in line with common C-C bond length versus bond strengths correlations. We suggest that the extraordinary stabilization arises from numerous intramolecular van der Waals attractions between the neighboring H-terminated diamond-like surfaces. The C-C bond rotational dynamics of 1-(1-adamantyl)diamantane, 1-(1-diamantyl)diamantane, 2-(1-adamantyl)triamantane, 2-(1-diamantyl)triamantane, and 2-(1-diamantyl)[121]tetramantane were studied through variable-temperature 1H- and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The shapes of the inward (endo) CH surfaces determine the dynamic behavior, changing the central C-C bond rotation barriers from 7 to 33 kcal mol-1. We probe the ability of popular density functional theory (DFT) approaches (including BLYP, B3LYP, B98, B3LYP-Dn, B97D, B3PW91, BHandHLYP, B3P86, PBE1PBE, wB97XD, and M06-2X) with 6-31G(d,p) and cc-pVDZ basis sets to describe such an unusual bonding situation. Only functionals accounting for dispersion are able to reproduce the experimental geometries, while most DFT functionals are able to reproduce the experimental rotational barriers due to error cancellations. Computations on larger diamondoids reveal that the interplay between the shapes and the sizes of the CH surfaces may even allow the preparation of open-shell alkyl radical dimers (and possibly polymers) that are strongly held together exclusively by dispersion forces.},

Minimum-energy structures of three neutral and six protonated species for each anomer were calculated. Geometries, energies, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these structures are discussed. For the neutral species at 298 K the order of stability for the hydroxymethyl conformers is calculated to be GT > GG > TG for the $\alpha$ anomer and GG > GT > TG for the $\beta$ anomer. Protonated species that least disrupt the internal hydrogen bonding network in the neutral species are considered; these include protonations on the oxygen sites labeled as the hydroxymethyl O6, the ring O5, and the exocylic hydroxyl O4. The O6 protonation in the TG conformation is electronically most favored. Energy corrections for basis-set deficiency and electron-correlation omission in the adopted theoretical procedure were estimated from high-level calculations on ethanol, 2-propanol, and dimethyl ether. In addition, the gas-phase basicity (GB) of glucose was measured by proton transfer reactions in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The experimental GB values for both anomers were determined to be 188 ± 3 kcal/mol. The experimental values are compared with the ab initio estimates of 178−190 and 177−189 kcal/mol for the respective $\alpha$ and $\beta$ anomers. Theoretical structures for the lowest-electronic-energy protonated species in the three hydroxymethyl conformations of each anomer are also presented to serve as reference data for postulating various kinetic pathways.},

The reaction barrier for the proton-catalyzed glucose condensation reaction is solvent induced because of proton’s high affinity for water.

Geometries of reactant complexes, transition states, intermediates, and completely denitrated product were optimized at the density functional theory (DFT) level using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution.

Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were also performed to validate the computed transition state structures. Effect of electron correlation on computed energies was considered through a single point energy calculation at the MP2 level using the cc-pVTZ basis set.

Experimental findings revealed that the most important fire properties such as ignition time, mass loss rate and ash content exhibited significant differences between the two structures of NC. Compared with the soft fiber NC, chip NC possesses a lower fire hazard, and its heat release rate intensity (HRRI) is mainly affected by the sample mass. In addition, oxygen consumption (OC) calorimetry method was compared with thermal chemistry (TC) method based on stoichiometry for HRRI calculation. HRRI results of NC with two structures obtained by these two methods showed a good consistency.},

  abstract    = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a relatively sensitive explosive used in many electroexplosive devices as well as in medicine. Of primary interest to LLNL is its use in items such as exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators and exploding bridge foil initiators (EFI). In these devices the crystalline powder is pressed into a granular, low-density compact that can be initiated by an exploding wire or foil. The long-term stability of this pressed compact is of interest to weapon stockpile lifetime prediction studies. Key points about potential aging mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1) There are a number of factors that can contribute to PETN instability. These include particle size, polymorphic phase transitions, crystal structure, impurities, moisture, occlusions, chemical incompatibility and biological (microorganism) action. of these factors the most important for long-term aging of high surface area powders used in detonators appears to be that of particle size growth. (2) There is a great deal of literature on the thermal degradation kinetics of PETN, unfortunately much of it with little bearing on ambient temperature aging during long-term storage. PETN is very stable with respect to thermal decomposition. Low-temperature thermal studies have not revealed evidence of chemical degradation products in archived PETN. Data extrapolated to 30 C predicts a half-life of 12 million years. (3) Moisture seems to lower the activation energy for and accelerate the decomposition of PETN. (4) External drivers affecting stability include temperature, moisture, radiation fields, and stress, while internal drivers include residual solvents, and impurities. Temperature affects kinetic processes of crystal growth such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion rates of molecules on the surface of PETN crystals. A low-level radiation field may induce unexpected changes in the chemical makeup of PETN and its homologue impurities. Stress at high pressure points caused by crystalline surface irregularities may cause a decrease in surface area over time due to smoothing of contact points and sintering. PETN has been found to contain a number of impurities, including homologues, pentaerythryl ethers with a mixture of hydroxyl and nitrate functional groups, and organic salts, that can alter its physical and chemical properties. (5) The processes of sublimation/recrystallization and surface diffusion are important processes that can cause changes in PETN crystal morphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area. Sublimation feeds a process called Ostwald ripening, which involves the spontaneous growth of larger crystals from those of smaller size. This process proceeds with age regardless of storage conditions unless the crystals are treated to retard growth. The coarsening mechanisms include Ostwald ripening, 'sintering', and surface diffusion. The latter has not been experimentally observed, but a molecular modeling approach has attempted to investigate this phenomenon theoretically. (6) Threshold test fire, particle size distribution, specific surface area, thermal analysis, chemical analysis, powder compact specific surface area and density are approaches that have been used in the attempt to assess changes attributable to aging of PETN, with varying results. The biggest problem lies in the aging mechanism itself, which likely influences small changes in morphology, both internal and external, and particle size distribution changes on a scale too small to reliably monitor. Other aspects, such as subtle changes in density profiles within pressed powder compacts, may be beyond the capability of current technology to assess. Crystal growth significant enough to affect the PETN particle size distribution is expected to impact detonator performance. (7) Factors relevant to stabilizing particle size growth include crystal morphology, powder surface area and particle size distribution; crystal density and internal defects; and powder compact density and density gradients.},

  abstract    = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is used throughout the stockpile as an energetic material. The formulation of PETN into XTX8003 (80% PETN, 20% Sylgard 182) creates an extrudable energetic composite. PETN and XTX8003 are used in the firesets for the retired W68 (MC2370) and the W76 (MC3028). When faced with potential lifetime extensions, energetic materials are naturally suspect regarding their output after prolonged aging. The authors have studied PETN and XTX8003 by looking at 25-year-old samples from retired MC2370s and newer materials. Both the old and new materials have also been placed in various accelerated aging protocols to investigate any decomposition that might occur over time. PETN is known to decompose autocatalytically even in the early stages of decomposition, but the process is poorly understood. Published values for the activation energy of decomposition vary by >40 kcal/mol. The 12 million year half life predicted for room temperature PETN would be dramatically shortened by chemical influences that lead to lower energy decomposition pathways. Degree of confinement, purity, and crystal size all influence degradation rates. In this paper, the authors observe the effects of chemical and thermal aging on PETN. They anticipate changes in mechanism at higher temperature aging, and before trying to extrapolate to lower temperatures, they want to make sure that they understand the different chemical processed involved.},

Decomposition was more rapid as the temperature was raised and attained a maximum rate between 65?75% HNO3. Spent nitrating acids decomposed more rapidly than pure acids with PETN, due to the presence of about 0.5% dipentaerythrital hexanitrate (DiPEHN) formed from dipentaerythritol in the original PE. The decomposition of PETN in nitric acids was strongly catalysed by NO2, especially at high acid strength. The course of the decomposition as deduced from this evidence appeared to embrace (1) hydrolysis, (2) oxidation of hydrolysis products liberating NO2, (3) destruction of PETN by a mechanism catalysed by NO2 in which hydrolysis plays no part.},

Often 0.2% DPA is used as a minimum content for safe propellants. In most cases the propellant can be stored much longer after this limit has been reached without any risk for self-ignition. We report here about a reaction where DPA bonds to nitrocellulose, leaving a non extractable aromatic stabilizing compound left in the propellant, resulting in a longer time to autocatalysis than predicted. Diphenylnitramine is discussed as a possible intermediary compound occurring from the reaction between DPA and nitrocellulose. This should add to a better understanding of the degradation processes in propellants.},

However, the few papers that focused on the determination of nitrocellulose used in explosives employed analytical techniques [e.g., vibrational techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy), MS and ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and liquid chromatography (LC) (high-performance LC and ion chromatography)]. Most of the information reported by these techniques has been qualitative. Only quantitative determination of nitrocellulose or its nitrogen content has been performed by measuring the nitrite and/or nitrate ions released from its basic hydrolysis.},

This study sheds much needed light on the atomic decomposition mechanisms of nitroesters with an example of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (C5H8N4O12, also known as PETN), used as an explosive and a medication. The performed study is based on density functional theory combined with variational transition-state theory and large-scale massively parallel periodic supercell calculations and presents a detailed analysis of thermal initiation of chemical reactions and their kinetics in the gas-phase PETN molecules, the ideal bulk crystals, and on two low energy surfaces, (101) and (110). The obtained activation barriers, reaction energies, and reaction rates of simulated bond dissociation mechanisms reveal that the overall decomposition of condensed nitroesters is defined by the interplay of two major reactions, the fast endothermic O-NO2 homolysis and the slow exothermic HONO elimination. While the O-N cleavage has a low activation barrier and essentially initiates the degradation of the material, the HONO elimination pathway serves to accelerate the global process by generating heat to support the reaction. This trend is suggested to be general for a large class of traditional and novel nitroesters.},

  abstract = {A non-destructive UV-Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO-NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV-Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time’ plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO-NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO-NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO-NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO-NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 > C2 > C3.},

A noticeable shifting in the UV/visible spectra toward higher wavelength and decrease in the optical band gap were observed as the gamma irradiation increases.

This adaptation has made it possible to make real-time measurements on the decomposition of nitrocellulose (NC) and PBX 9404 at realistic storage temperatures for these materials.

NOx (= NO + NO2) evolution in NC decomposition occurs with a k(T) of (1.9 ÷× 2) × 107exp [(−12800 ± 300)T] s−1 below 350°K, while above 370°K k(T) = (4.3 ÷× 4) × 1017exp [(−21500 ± 750)T] s−1, both per submole (molecular weight 264) NC. Prior T ≥ 370°K exposure of NC leads to increased evolution rates at ≤ 350°K because of the desorption of the NOx, which was adsorbed at the higher temperature. NO2 is shown to be the primary NC decomposition product and is rapidly reduced to NO. PBX 9404 results are compared to NC results and it is shown that diphenylamine, present in PBX 9404, catalyzes NC decomposition and also reduced NO2 to NO.},

It was found that protonation of the C2-OH on glucose, the breakage of the C2-O2 bond, and the formation of the C2-O5 bond is the critical rate-limiting step for the direct glucose conversion to HMF without converting to fructose first, contrary to the wide-spread assumption in literature that fructose is the main intermediate for glucose conversion to HMF.

  abstract  = {The mechanism of neutral hydrolysis of ester has long been explored by theoretical studies. However, reliable theoretical calculations show that the usual bifunctional catalysis mechanism reported by different authors cannot explain the experimental kinetics. An important advance was recently reported by Gunaydin and Houk, suggesting that ions are involved in the mechanism and the process initiates by water autoionization followed by protonation of the ester (WAIA mechanism). However, this mechanism does not explain the hydrolysis of activated esters. In this work, we have used ab initio calculations, continuum solvation models, and intrinsic reaction coordinate method to support the WAIA mechanism for normal ester. In the case of activated esters, the process can also be viewed as water autoionization with formation of hydroxide ion aided by a second water molecule acting as a general base (WAIB mechanism). This is the mechanism that was proposed by Jencks and Carriuolo 50 years ago. Our analysis point out that the usual method for exploring mechanisms, searching for saddle points, may not work for problems like the present one, since there are no saddle points on the reaction pathway. Rather, the formation of a pair of ions from a neutral species may have an asymptotic barrier. The approach used in this paper allows the calculation of the free energy profile and enable us to explain the mechanism and kinetics of the neutral hydrolysis of normal (methyl acetate) and activated (methyl trifluoroacetate) esters. In addition, the present study suggests that formation of a pair of ions should always be considered in reactions in aqueous solution.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The free-energy profile for the different reaction pathways available to the hydroxide ion and methyl formate in aqueous solution is reported for the first time. The theoretical analysis was carried out by using the cluster-continuum method recently proposed by us for calculating the free energy of solvation of ions. Unlike the gas-phase reaction, our results are consistent with the fact that the reaction occurs mainly by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide on the carbonyl carbon to yield a tetrahedral intermediate (BAC2 mechanism). However, an additional pathway, in which the hydroxide ion acts as a general base and a water molecule coordinated to this ion acts as the nucleophile, is also predicted to be important. The relative importance of these pathways is calculated to be 87?% and 13?%, respectively. The tetrahedral intermediate of the hydrolysis reaction has an estimated lifetime of 10 nanoseconds, and its conjugate acid has a pKa of 8.8. This tetrahedral intermediate is predicted to proceed to products by two pathways: elimination of methoxide ion (84?%) and by water catalyzed elimination of methanol (16?%). The less common reaction pathway, which involves attack of the hydroxide ion on the formyl hydrogen (decarbonylation mechanism) and leads to water, carbon monoxide, and methanol, is calculated to be only 3 kcal?mol?1 less favorable than the BAC2 mechanism. By comparison, direct attack of the hydroxide ion on the methyl group (BAL2 or SN2 mechanism) leading to an acyl-oxygen bond cleavage has a very high free energy of activation and is not expected to be important. The theoretically observed activation free energy at 298.15 K is calculated to be 15.5 kcal?mol?1, in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured value of 15.3 kcal?mol?1. This present model allows for a clear distinction between contributions due to solvation and those due to intrinsic (gas-phase) effects and proves to yield results in very good agreement with available experimental data.},

The grain size of clinoptilolite stabilizer played an important role in the stabilization effect. As the grain size of stabilizer decreases, the surface area of stabilizer increases and the ability to absorb pronounce amount of hazardous nitrogen oxides increases. In this work clinoptilolite in nano-scale (30nm) has been used to obtain higher stabilizing effect for DBPs. The evaluation process has been performed through the classical thermal stability tests (Bergmann-Junk and calorimetric tests), in comparison with thermal analyses measurements (TGA and DSC) and kinetic parameters calculation such as activation energy (Ea), enthalpy of activation (ΔH*), Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG*), entropy of activation (ΔS*) and frequency factor (A), which calculated using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The results for the new stabilizers were compared with that for the classical one (N,N-diethyldiphenyl urea, C1). It has been found that the samples containing new stabilizer with percentages (3.0, 3.5 and 4.0%) showed better stability effect for DBPs than the classical one. The efficiency of stabilization of each inorganic stabilizer to DBPs is also rationalized and correlated with its structure.},

  abstract = {Aliphatic nitrate esters are currently the most widely used energetic ingredients in single-, double-, and triple-base propellants. These nitrate esters are unstable at ambient conditions, and stabilizing agents should be incorporated into the energetic compositions to inhibit and slow down the decomposition reactions that can occur. However, the currently used stabilizers present a number of environmental and human health issues. To overcome these shortcomings, many stabilizers have been appeared in the past few decades and continue to be developed. Furthermore, several analytical techniques have been introduced to monitor the stability of nitrate ester-based energetic materials as well, since the existing ones could not be efficiently applied. Therefore, this review paper discusses and summarizes the current and emergent stabilizers as well as their mechanisms of action. A critical and analytical examination of their advantages and drawbacks is made.},

  abstract = {The granules containing nitrogen of various content (12.2-13.3%) and stabilizers (centralite I, centralite II, akardite II, triphenylamine) were obtained in laboratory scale, and the study of their physicochemical and thermal properties was conducted. It has been observed that the helium density of granules depends on the degree of gelling of nitrocellulose by the stabilizer as well as the lack of effect of the stabilizer type on the heat of combustion value. In turn, the heat of combustion depends on the content of nitrogen in nitrocellulose. Granules of 13.3% N nitrocellulose were characterized by a more rapidly developing thermal decomposition than the granules containing 12.2 and 12.9% N nitrocellulose. The maximum temperature of decomposition shifts toward higher temperatures (from 207.6 to 209.8 °C) with decreasing nitrogen content in nitrocellulose for granules containing triphenylamine as a stabilizer. All values of heat generation rate obtained for granules with triphenylamine were lower than the respective rates for granules with centralite I. Thermal properties and chemical stability of granules containing triphenylamine have better properties, when compared to other examined stabilizers. On the basis of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry, kinetic parameters were calculated by means of Ozawa-Flynn-Wall analysis. The effect of stabilizers and nitrogen content on kinetic parameters was determined. The kinetic model of thermal decomposition of granules was adjusted--the best fit was nth-order reaction with autocatalysis. The activation energy of thermal decomposition process according to the adopted chemical reaction model increases from 190 to 239 kJ mol−1 with increasing nitrogen content in the granulate.},
  comment  = {'During extended storage of the polymer, nitrogen oxide compounds can be emitted due to a low value of bond energy (155 kJ mol−1) of ester functional group -CH2O-NO2 [3, 4]. These nitrogen oxide compounds lead to destabilization of NC. In order to prevent this process from taking place, stabilizers for nitrocellulose products are introduced. These additives do not hinder decomposition process entirely and, however, may contribute to the reduction of autocatalytic effect of decomposition. Most stabilizers act based on the principle of chemical interactions, which include binding the products of decomposition [5, 6]. Derivatives of urea or aniline such as centralite, diphenylamine, akardite and 2-nitrodiphenylamine constitute the most commonly used stabilizers [6, 7]. Other stabilizers are investigated, as derivatives of urea and aniline produce carcinogenic nitrosamines by reaction with nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, diphenylamine (DPA) has toxic properties [3]. For this reason, new compounds are proposed as stabilizers for nitrocellulose, such as triphenylamine (TPA) [4], deprived of toxic properties. The reaction of this stabilizer with nitric oxides leads to the formation of nitro derivatives.'},

  abstract  = {“Flash Paper” is a nitrocellulose paper commonly used in magicians’ routines and accessible in magician supply stores. The intrinsic nitrate concentration determines its pyrotechnic characteristics, and this form of nitrocellulose is classified as an explosive (National Centre for Biotechnology Information 2009).

The fast disappearing Flash Paper can be used to give the illusion of throwing fire when lit by a hidden ignition source. Performed correctly, the stunt causes no injury to the magician, however, improper use of the material has the potential to cause serious injury, burning at a maximum temperature of approximately 209°C (He, et al. 2017; DeHaan 1975).

This is a case report of a thirteen year old admitted to a quaternary children’s hospital in Brisbane, Australia with burns sustained when a roll of Flash Paper ignited on his lap while experimenting with friends. Partial thickness burns were sustained involving bilateral medial thighs, the left side of the face and left pinna as well as mild conjunctival burns to his left eye. His treatment required an inpatient admission, ophthalmology treatment and outpatient burns dressings. Re-epithelialisation had occurred to the majority of his wounds including his conjunctival burn by Day 9. On follow up at Day 16, there was complete re-epithelialisation of all wounds.

Reports of Flash Paper burns have not to date been published. While the purchase of nitrocellulose products is restricted to persons over 18 years. Precautions must be taken in order to ensure the safety of novice magicians employing this easily obtainable form of nitrocellulose.

To eliminate the reactivity of nitro groups, the degradation of ethylcellulose was also investigated. Infrared spectroscopy analyses of the chemical modifications caused by the photooxidation of cellulose nitrate films and the resulting formation of volatile products revealed the occurrence of de-nitration and the formation of oxidation photoproducts exhibiting lactone and anhydride functions. The impact of these chemical modifications on the mechanical and thermal properties of cellulose nitrate films includes embrittlement and lower temperatures of ignition when used as a propellant.},

  abstract = {The oxidation of nitrocellulose (NC) containing 13.38% nitrogen has been investigated. The oxidation process under the action of hard UV radiation and ozone has been conducted for 27 h. As result, the nitrogen content of NC has decreased by less than 4.0%. For oxidation using Desulfovibrio (D.) desulfuricans sulfate-reducing bacteria, NC has been incubated with these bacteria for 65 days. This processing has reduced the nitrogen content of NC by 1.66���2.8%. D. desulfuricans incubation with NC pretreated with UV light + ozone has decreased the nitrogen content of the sample by at most 2.75% (compared to the baseline). UV + ozone pretreatment enables subsequent NC oxidation by D. desulfuricans: the resulting samples are richer in low-molecular-weight fractions and nitrate and nitro groups, and they reach their maximum extent of oxidation within 16 h of incubation with the bacteria, whereas the untreated samples oxidize to the maximum extent in 38 h. It is likely that the UV + ozone treatment cleaves carbon���carbon bonds in the polymer chain and lowers the degree of polymerization of individual chains, thereby facilitating the penetration of bacteria into the bulk polymer globules and the bacterial oxidation of ester bonds.},

The ability to characterize small differences in the crystalline structures of cellulose from fibers of different origins is thus highly important. In this work, dynamic FT-IR spectroscopy has been further explored as a method sensitive to cellulose structure variations. Using a model system of two different celluloses, the relation between spectral information and the relative cellulose I$\alpha$ content was investigated. This relation was then used to determine the relative cellulose I$\alpha$ content in different pulps. The estimated cellulose I allomorph compositions were found to be reasonable for both unbleached and bleached chemical pulps. In addition, it was found that the dynamic FT-IR spectroscopy technique had the potential to indicate possible correlation field splitting peaks of cellulose I$\alpha$.},

In addition, compounds including hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, methane, nitrogen oxides, benzene, acrylonitrile, toluene, furan, aromatic amines, benzopyrene, and various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are detected in minor concentrations. The literature shows that the thermodynamic prediction of the major decomposition products agrees fairly well with the measurements. However, poor agreement is found for the minor species. We have studied the thermal decomposition products of the main gunpowder ingredients. Each of the components nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine, and the nitrate ester stabilizers diphenylamine and ethyl centralite were thermally decomposed with ReaxFF reactive force field molecular dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics. The molecular dynamics results for the major decomposition products from nitrocellulose were partly consistent with measurements. Compared to the thermodynamic calculations, the molecular dynamics simulations agreed considerably better with experimental results for minor species like hydrogen cyanide. The nitrate ester stabilizers are the main sources for ammonia and aromatic combustion products, whereas hydrogen cyanide is produced from nitrocellulose as well as from the stabilizers when gunpowder is combusted.},

The rate-limiting step in sugar degradation was found to be protonation of the hydroxyl groups on the sugar ring. We found that the structure of water molecules plays a significant role in the acidic sugar degradation pathways. Firstly, a water molecule competes with the hydroxyl group on the sugar ring for protons. Secondly, water forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the sugar rings, thus weakening the C-C and C-O bonds (each to a different degree). Note that the reaction pathways could be altered due to the change of relative stability of the C-C and C-O bonds. Thirdly, water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded to sugar hydroxyls could easily extract a proton from the reaction intermediate, terminating the reaction. Indeed, the sugar degradation pathway is complex due to multiple protonation probabilities and the surrounding water structure. Our experimental data support multiple sugar acidic degradation pathways.},

In the case of glucose, a series of intermediates were observed before forming the 2,5-anhydride intermediate that eventually leads to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). One of these intermediates was a very short-lived open-chain form. Furthermore, two novel side-reaction pathways were identified, which lead to degradation products other than HMF.},

The study included parameterisation of force fields for nitrocellulose; 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane; the stabilizer ethyl centralite; and the overall nitrocellulose binder mixtures. Simulated densities obtained were in very good agreement with experimental densities. The diffusion coefficients compare favourably with experimental values available for similar systems, when differences such as the proportions of plasticisers are taken into consideration. Examination of the plasticiser diffusion rates suggests that 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane migrates more slowly from a nitrocellulose binder than 2,4-dinitroethylbenzene for the nitrocellulose and plasticiser proportions used in this study. Understanding plasticiser migration is essential for the long-term storage of energetic material formulations without significant changes occurring in their properties or compositions.},

Approximately 20-30 water molecules were included along with the acid in the QM portion of the calculation, which was carried out at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level. Whereas dissociation to ions is always spontaneous in the bulk, we find that acid molecules confined to the water surface dissociate only with the participation of two additional water molecules, forming a critical cluster about the solute. Thus acid dissociation may occur in the near-surface zone at a dynamic air-water interface, in agreement with our earlier experimental conclusions [Clifford et al., Phys. Chem. Chem.

We established a relationship between the form of vibration bands of the nitrate groups and their position and conformation state in the glucopyranose cycle of CN. The relative intensities of the valence vibration bands of the CH2 groups are explained by the Fermi resonance with a complex tone of valence vibrations of the nitrate groups. In view of the strong dichroism of some low-frequency bands in the IR spectrum of CN, we offer assignments of these bands to vibrations of the chain skeleton and suggest the rationale for the high orientation of CN macromolecules both in the ordered and disordered regions. Such an orientation is assumed to be inherited by CN from the starting cellulose.},

These reactions are key primary reactions in thermal processes for the production of carbon-neutral, renewable transportation fuels. Previous literature reports have proposed a variety of mainly heterolytic and homolytic mechanisms, but there has been insufficient evidence to settle the debate. Using density functional theory (DFT) methods and implicit solvent, we compared the likelihood of forming either radical or ionic intermediates. We discovered a concerted reaction mechanism that is more favorable than previously proposed mechanisms and is in better alignment with experimental findings. This new understanding of the mechanism of cellulose thermal decomposition opens the door to accurate process modeling and educated catalyst design, which are vital steps toward producing more cost-efficient renewable energy.},

Previous studies have been extensively focused on a two-step process for producing 5-HMF from glucose or cellulose, i.e., the isomerization of glucose into fructose and then the dehydration of fructose. We herein discovered that heterogeneous sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfide) (SPPS) containing strong Brønsted acid sites is able to convert glucose and cellulose into 5-HMF with a high yield in ionic liquids (ILs). The optimal activity of glucose conversion to 5-HMF achieves a yield of 87.2% after 4 h reaction at 140 °C. For direct cellulose conversion, a 5-HMF yield of 68.2% can be achieved. The reaction mechanism over the SPPS catalyst in ILs was studied by DFT calculations, and the results indicated that the SO3H group of SPPS plays a crucial role in glucose conversion into 5-HMF, and it acts as a proton donor as a Brønsted acid and functions as a proton acceptor as the conjugate base. Furthermore, the anions and cations of ILs together with SO3H-SPPS helped in stabilizing the reaction intermediates and transition states, which also resulted in glucose facile conversion into 5-HMF. The new catalyst system highlights new opportunities offered by optimizing the production of 5-HMF directly from glucose and cellulose.},

The validity of these force fields was assessed by comparing structures and energies of cellobiose, which is the shortest cellulose chain, obtained from the force fields with those obtained from MP2 and DFT methods. In agreement with the first principles methods, COMPASS is the only force field of the three studied here that favors the anti form of cellobiose in the vacuum. This force field was also used to compare changes in energies when hydrating cellobiose with 1-4 water molecules. Although the COMPASS force field does not yield the change from anti to syn minimum energy structure when hydrating with more than two water molecules - as predicted by DFT - it does predict that the syn conformer is preferred when simulating cellobiose in bulk liquid water and at temperatures relevant to cellulose dissolution. This indicates that the COMPASS force field yields valid structures of cellulose under these conditions. Simulations based on the COMPASS force field show that, due to entropic effects, the syn form of cellobiose is energetically preferred at elevated temperature, both in vacuum and in bulk water. This is also in agreement with DFT calculations.},

Since water is an observed product of fast pyrolysis of cellulose, the energetics of the dehydration reactions of cellulose were explored computationally by using density functional theory. Glucose and cellobiose were selected as the cellulose model compounds. The four water loss mechanisms studied are Maccoll elimination, Pinacol ring contraction, cyclic Grob fragmentation, and alcohol condensation, some of which have not been considered previously in the literature. Levoglucosan formation via alcohol condensation has the lowest calculated free-energy barrier (50.4 kcal mol-1) for glucose dehydration. All other water loss reactions have calculated free-energy barriers greater than 60 kcal mol-1. Cellobiose dehydration shows similar trends to those of glucose, suggesting that these reactions are applicable to glucooligosaccharides with higher degrees of polymerization. Secondary reactions of dehydrated glucose and dehydrated cellobiose via retro-Diels-Alder and aldol rearrangement mechanisms are also explored computationally.},

ETN and DNTN both melt below 100?°C and have ambient vapor pressures comparable to TNT. While LC/MS was shown to be a viable technique for analysis of all three tetranitrate esters, only ETN was successfully analyzed by GC/MS. Performance of these nitrate esters as evaluated in lab using the small-scale explosivity device (SSED) suggested RDX?DNTN>PETN>ETN. Detonation velocities were calculated using Cheetah 6.0. Since the starting material is now widely available, it is likely that law enforcement will find ETN in future improvised explosive devices. This paper with its analytical schemes should prove useful in identification of this homemade explosive.},

From these studies it becomes apparent that the PETN decomposition mechanisms and the resulting byproducts are primarily determined by the chemical environment. In the absence of water, PETN can decompose through the scission of the O-NO{sup 2} bond resulting in the formation of an alkoxy radical and NO{sub 2}. Because of the relatively high reactivity of both these initial byproducts, they are believed to drive a number of autocatalytic reactions eventually forming (NO{sub 2}OCH{sub 2}){sub 3}CCHO, (NO{sub 2}OCH{sub 2}){sub 2}C=CHONO{sub 2}, NO{sub 2}OCH=C=CHONO{sub 2}, (NO{sub 2}OCH{sub 2}){sub 3}C-NO{sub 2}, (NO{sub 2}OCH{sub 2}){sub 2}C(NO{sub 2}){sub 2}, NO{sub 2}OCH{sub 2}C(NO{sub 2}){sub 3}, and C(NO{sub 2}){sub 4} as well as polymer-like species such as di-PEHN and tri-PEON. Surprisingly, the products of many of these proposed autocatalytic reactions have never been analytically validated. Conversely, in the presence of water, PETN has been shown to decompose primarily to mono, di, and tri nitrates of pentaerythritol.},

  abstract = {Standard quantum chemical methods are used for accurate calculation of thermochemical properties such as enthalpies of formation, entropies and Gibbs energies of formation. Equilibrium reactions are widely investigated and experimental measurements often lead to a range of reaction Gibbs energies and equilibrium constants. It is useful to calculate these equilibrium properties from quantum chemical methods in order to address the experimental differences. Furthermore, most standard calculation methods differ in accuracy and feasibility of the system size. Hence, a systematic comparison of equilibrium properties calculated with different numerical algorithms would provide a useful reference. We select two well-known gas phase equilibrium reactions with small molecules: covalent dimer formation of NO2 (2NO2⇌N2O4) and the synthesis of NH3 (N2 + 3H2⇌2NH3). We test four quantum chemical methods denoted by G3B3, CBS-APNO, W1 and CCSD(T) with aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets (X=2, 3, and 4), to obtain thermochemical data for NO2, N2O4, and NH3. The calculated standard formation Gibbs energies ΔfG° are used to calculate standard reaction Gibbs energies ΔrG° and standard equilibrium constants Keq for the two reactions. Standard formation enthalpies ΔfH° are calculated in a more reliable way using high-level methods such as W1 and CCSD(T). Standard entropies S° for the molecules are calculated well within the range of experiments for all methods, however, the values of standard formation Gibbs energies ΔfG° show some dependence on the choice of the method. High-level methods perform better for the calculation of molecular energies, however, simpler methods such as G3B3 and CBS-APNO perform quite well in the calculation of total reaction energies and equilibrium constants, provided that the chemical species involved do not exhibit molecular geometries that are difficult to handle by the applied method. The temperature dependence of standard reaction Gibbs energy ΔrG° for the NH3 reaction is discussed by using the calculated standard formation Gibbs energies ΔfG° of the reaction species at 298.15K. The corresponding equilibrium constant Keq as a function of temperature is found to be close to experimental values.},

However, most of the experiments were carried out under high heating rates, a situation in which it is difficult to capture minor changes during the thermal decomposition process. In the present study, the thermal characteristics of NC with different nitrogen contents were theoretically and experimentally investigated using a CALVET heat flux calorimeter C80 at heating rates from 0.2 to 0.8 °C/min. Before thermal analysis, the results of high-precision scanning electron microscopy showed that more cracks and coarser surfaces were detected on NC fibers with higher nitrogen contents. It was found that a “turning point” was detected on the heat flow curves of NC with higher nitrogen contents. Furthermore, the heat flow curves of NC transformed from “bell shape” to “right triangles” with increases in the nitrogen content, which suggested that NC with high nitrogen contents exhibited autocatalysis characteristics under low heating rates. This characteristic was also confirmed by the isothermal experiment results that showed the autocatalytic properties became increasingly obvious by increasing the isothermal temperature. Moreover, the relevant chemical kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were obtained. The heat of the reaction (ΔH) increased and the activation energy values in the initial stages of NC decomposition decreased as the nitrogen content was increased. Furthermore, the critical explosion temperature (Tb), which is as an important parameter to evaluate the thermal hazard of NC, decreased by elevating the nitrogen content.},

The results indicated that the thermal history significantly influenced the dynamic DSC curves, decomposition kinetics and thermal stability of NC, which decomposes autocatalytically.

  abstract  = {Abstract Nitrocellulose based (NC) and nitroglycerin based (NG) propellants often have a fixed acid and water content during the manufacturing time. After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a π complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a π complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Benzyl nitrite (PhCH2ONO) was previously identified as the pivotal intermediate in the HNO3-mediated oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Its acid-catalyzed decomposition yields benzaldehyde and HNO, the precursor of undesirable N2O. Most likely, an analogous mechanism is responsible for the formation of N2O during the oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone to adipic acid, the largest industrial source of this important greenhouse gas. In this paper, the decomposition of benzyl nitrite is studied in more detail, allowing the kinetic isotope effect and the influence of substituents to be determined. A linear Evans?Polanyi correlation between the measured Arrhenius activation energies and the computed reaction energies was established. Furthermore, the differences in the reactivities of the substituted benzyl nitrites are reflected in the oxidation of the corresponding alcohols, and also affect the rate-determining step in the overall mechanism. The results of this study corroborate the importance of the nitrite intermediate in HNO3-based oxidation technology.},

The results show, in agreement with previous suggestions from this laboratory, that ethanol is firstly oxidized to acetaldehyde via a reaction initiated by nitric acid but carried on by NO2 radical. The latter is formed by the interaction of nitric and nitrous acids. The acetaldehyde is then oxidized by two independent paths leading one to acetic acid and the other to oxalic acid and eventually to CO2. The relevance of these findings on the understanding and on the control of ?spent acids?? is briefly discussed.},

The proposed mechanism explains the conversion of unreactive alkyl peroxy radicals into alkoxy radicals:  CH3O2 + NO ⇆ CH3OONO ⇆ CH3O + NO2 ⇆ CH3ONO2. Additionally, several discrepancies found in the comparison of the results obtained from the two employed approaches are analyzed. CASPT2 predicts that all dissociation reactions into radicals occur without an extra exit energy barrier. In contrast, DFT finds transition states for the dissociations of cis- and trans-methylperoxy nitrite into CH3O + NO2. Furthermore, multiconfigurational methods [CASPT2 and complete active space SCF (CAS-SCF)] predict the isomerization of CH3ONO2 to CH3OONO to occur in a two-step mechanism:  (i) CH3ONO2 $\rightarrow$ CH3O + NO2; and (ii) CH3O + NO2 $\rightarrow$ CH3OONO. The reason for this has to do with the coupling of the ground electronic state with the first excited state. Therefore, it is demonstrated that DFT methods based on single determinantal wave functions give an incorrect picture of the aforementioned reaction mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Activation energies for nitrocellulose (NC) degradation have been determined from Arrhenius plots constructed using first-order rate constants measured at 40, 50 and 60°C. The rate constants were obtained by monitoring the absorbance (A) at a wavelength in the visible region of an anthraquinone dye dispersed in NC thin films. The dye acts as a stabilizer and is slowly depleted as a result of its reaction with NOx from the breakdown of the nitrate ester groups on NC. The data produced two linear regions in the first-order plots of ln(A0/At) vs aging time. The first-region is attributed to the reaction of the dye with NOx desorbed from the NC surface. The activation energy ($\pm$73.5kJmol−1) is in line with that found for NOx surface desorption processes. The second linear region is thought to be due to the reaction of NOx from the breakdown of the nitrate ester groups on the NC molecule. The activation energy ($\pm$104.0kJmol−1) is consistent with that for nitrate ester hydrolysis. The use of UV-visible spectroscopy has in this way made it possible to monitor the degradation of NC non-destructively without the need for stabilizer extraction and analysis.},

Scanning electron microscopy of the NC aerogel reveals that the aerogel is accumulated by nanoparticles with a diameter of 30-50 nm and has nano-porous structure, which makes the thermal behavior of the NC aerogel different from that of the NC fibers. Therefore, the thermal properties of NC aerogel were determined by TG/DSC, which showed that the maximum decomposition temperature and the exothermic peak temperature of NC aerogel decreased 8.2 and 11.4 °C than NC fibers, respectively. By TG/FTIR technology combined FTIR test of the condensed phase, the decomposition mechanism was derived based on the experimental results. The initial reaction of NC aerogel decomposition is the splitting of urethane bond, and then, the scission of -O-NO2 bonds happens. Moreover, the macromolecular chains’ scission site of NC aerogel firstly occurs at -C-O-C- in the ring, while the chains of NC fibers break at -C-O-C- between the rings.},

  title        = {Plateau Burning Composite Propellant with Minimized Temperature Sensitivity},
  year         = {2013},
  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Develop a composite propellant which has an extended plateau region in its burning rate vs. pressure relationship curve, as well as minimized variation in ballistic performance as a function of temperature change. DESCRIPTION: Double base (nitrocellulose & nitroglycerine based) propellants widely used in Navy aircraft ejection seat systems experience degradation and depletion of the stabilizers used in the formulation over time with exposure to high operational and storage temperatures. This degradation results in safety risks due to the possibility of inadvertent spontaneous deflagration of the propellant. Current composite propellants typically do not have a pronounced plateau in their burning rate vs. pressure curves, and have a wider variation in performance with changes in temperature as compared to double base propellants. An innovative composite propellant to replace the current double based propellants used must be nitrate ester free and thermally stable across an operating temperature range from -65 degrees F to +200 degrees F. Ideally the propellant burning rate in the plateau region at ambient temperature would be approximately 1.0 inches per second at 2000 pounds per square inch (psi), followed by a negative slope in the burning rate curve, extending through at least 4500 to 5000 psi, and dropping by at least 0.4 inches per second. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Sigma sub p) would ideally be sp = 0.1 %/ K or less. Such a composite propellant would have performance characteristics similar to a plateau burning double base propellant, currently in use in Naval ejection seat systems, but without the limited life inherent in propellants containing nitrate esters. This formulation would be developed and validated through adjustments to the propellant composition, followed by burning rate testing to demonstrate the effects of adjustments made. The burning rates of the final formulation supplied to the Navy will be measured at -65F, ambient temperature, and +200F across the pressure range of 500 to 5000 PSI. The formulation must contain ingredients which have been tested to demonstrate compatibility with each other. Mechanical properties testing, as well as basic propellant safety and characterization tests in accordance with NAVSEAINST 8020.5C are to be conducted, so a Department of Defense Interim Hazard Classification can be obtained for the propellant. The tests would be conducted on zero-time and propellant samples aged for 64 days at 200F, and the results supplied to the Navy. PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of the composite propellant developed in accordance with the identified parameters. PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate through testing, a formulation which meets the performance objectives for burning rate and temperature sensitivity across the pressure range on zero-time and aged propellant samples. Characterization tests, scale up of the propellant manufacturing process, and manufacture of a quantity of propellant samples, one to two kilograms, for delivery to the Navy would also be performed in Phase II. PHASE III: Conduct the complete propellant characterization testing per NAVSEAINST 8020.5C and manufacture and transition a quantity of propellant samples for delivery to the Navy for testing. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: A composite propellant developed under this effort could be used in commercial mining, blasting, oil and gas exploration cartridge applications where consistent performance is required across a wide variation in temperature.

  abstract  = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

These calculations involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of up to spdfgh quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and contributions of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic effects, and (where relevant) first-order spin−orbit coupling. Our computational predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental data where these have small error bars; in a number of other instances reexamination of the experimental data may be in order. Our computed benchmark data (including cases for which experimental data are unavailable altogether) are used to assess the quality of a number of compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2 theory, G3 theory, and CBS-QB3, as well as a variety of density functional theory methods. Upon applying some modifications to the level of theory used for the reference geometry (adding diffuse functions, replacing B3LYP by the very recently proposed mPW1K functional [Lynch, B. J.; Fast, P. L.; Harris, M.; Truhlar, D. G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 4811]), the compound methods appear to perform well. Only the “half-and-half” functionals BH the other functionals fail to find a transition state in the F/Br case. BH this problem is resolved in HCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the functionals considered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound thermochemistry methods. mPW1K, however, appears to be very suitable for generating reference geometries for more elaborate thermochemical methods in kinetics applications.},

These calculations reveal that the approach of an OH? ion leads to the formation of two distinct ion-molecule complexes: 1) the MS1 species with the hydroxide ion hydrogen bonded to the methyl group of the ester, and 2) the MS4 moiety resulting from proton abstraction of the formyl hydrogen by the hydroxide ion and formation of a three-body complex of water, methoxide ion and carbon monoxide. The first complex reacts to generate formate anion and methanol products through the well known BAC2 and SN2 mechanisms. RRKM calculations predict that these pathways will occur with a relative contribution of 85?% and 15?% at 298.15?K, in excellent agreement with experimentally measured values of 87?% and 13?%, respectively. The second complex reacts by loss of carbon monoxide to yield the water?methoxide complex through a single minimum potential surface and is the preferred pathway in the gas-phase. This water?methoxide adduct can further dissociate if the reactants have excess energy. These results provide clear evidence that the preferred pathways for ester hydrolysis in solution are dictated by solvation of the hydroxide ion.},

The Landé g-formula for one electron is derived from the formula for the magnetic moment by neglecting ‘relativity’ terms.The formula for the magnetic moment suggests the question whether it is ever possible to specify the direction of the spin axis of the electron (as distinct from the magnetic moment of the whole atom). This is investigated, and it seems justifiable to specify the direction of the spin axis for states for which the magnetic quantum number m has its extreme values ±j, but not otherwise.},

Die Gleichungen, die sich für ψi(χ) ergeben, enthalten „Austauschglieder“ und können als Eulersche Gleichungen eines dreidimensionalen Variationsproblems mit der Energie als Wirkungsintegral [Formel (93)] aufgefaßt werden. Die Gleichungen sind nicht wesentlich komplizierter als die von Hartree, dürften aber viel genauere Resultate ergeben. Zum Schluß wird eine Formel für die Intensitäten angegeben, die- Glieder enthält, welche einer „Umgruppierung“ der inneren Elektronen bei einem Quantensprung entsprechen.},

  abstract  = {The extent of spin contamination in unrestricted versions of pure, hybrid and double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, and its consequences, as manifested in the difference between unrestricted and restricted energies (U − R), has been investigated for 22 homolytic bond dissociation reactions. In accordance with previous studies, increasing the amount of Hartree−Fock (HF) exchange in unrestricted hybrid DFT procedures leads to an increase in the extent of spin contamination. However, in unrestricted double-hybrid DFT procedures, which include both a proportion of HF exchange and a perturbative correlation contribution (MP2), the opposing behavior of UHF and UMP2 with respect to spin contamination leads to smaller differences between the energies predicted by unrestricted and restricted variants. For example, for the most spin-contaminated radicals, a 30−100 kJ mol−1 |U − R| difference at the HF and MP2 levels is reduced to just 0−5 kJ mol−1 with the double-hybrid functionals. The double-hybrid UDFT procedures can thus benefit from the inclusion of UHF and UMP2 contributions without incurring to the same extent the problems associated with spin contamination.},

In this work, we consider systems conventionally considered to be dominated by SIE. For these systems, we demonstrate that by using multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT), the error of a translated local density-functional approximation is significantly reduced (by a factor of 3) when using an MCSCF density and on-top density, as compared to using KS-DFT with the parent functional; the error in MC-PDFT with local on-top functionals is even lower than the error in some popular KS-DFT hybrid functionals. Density-functional theory, either in MC-PDFT form with local on-top functionals or in KS-DFT form with some functionals having 50% or more nonlocal exchange, has smaller errors for SIE-prone systems than does CASSCF, which has no SIE.},

Full geometry optimization was performed on different ring geometries and on the hydroxymethyl rotamers (gg/gt/tg). Analytically derived Hessians were used to calculate zero point energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The lowest energy and free energy conformation found is the $\alpha$-tg(g−)-4C1-c conformation, which is only slightly higher in electronic ($\pm$0.2kcal/mol) and free energy than the lowest energy $\alpha$-d-glucopyranose. The in vacuo calculations showed a small ($\pm$0.3kcal/mol) energetic preference for the $\alpha$- over the $\beta$-anomer for allopyranose in the 4C1 conformation, whereas in the 1C4 conformation a considerable ($\pm$1.6kcal/mol) energetic preference for the $\beta$- over the $\alpha$-anomer for allopyranose was encountered. The results are compared to previous aldohexose calculations in vacuo. Boat and skew forms were found that remained stable upon gradient optimization although many starting boat conformations moved to other skew forms upon optimization. As found for glucose, mannose, and galactose the orientation and interaction of the hydroxyl groups make the most significant contributions to the conformation/energy relationship in vacuo. A comparison of different basis sets and density functionals is made in the Discussion section, confirming the appropriateness of the level of theory used here.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R?6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol?1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R?6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract  = {Abstract An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R?6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The ?double counting? of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene · H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies. ? 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
