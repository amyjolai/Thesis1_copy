\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendices}

% The \appendix command resets the chapter counter, and changes the chapter numbering scheme to capital letters.

%Split appendicies by theme. E.g. One section is extra data, one section is working scripts, final one is notes and details about the working details of the calculations I did.
