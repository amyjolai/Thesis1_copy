\section{Introduction}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 4 pages%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Why can't we model the whole polymer / why do we need to truncate?
%What is contained in this chapter? What question is posed?

A wide range of reaction products are experimentally observed during the low temperature decomposition and slow ageing of \ac{NC}. Small gaseous species such as \ce{CO2}, \ce{CO}, \ce{CH2O}, \ce{N2O}, \ce{NO2} are idenitified using IR spectroscopy, whilst the presence of larger species such as glycolic acid and oxalate are alluded to in the spectra of the complex reaction mixture. \cite{jin2015,bluhm1977}
The generation of these products can be attributed to the range of susceptible attack sites along the polysaccharide backbone and at side groups, as well as the multitude of possible secondary reactions following denitration. These include depolymerisation and ring-cleavage, and can involve contaminants or acids remaining in the \ac{NC} matrix following synthesis, due to imperfect washing procedures\cite{Chin2007,Edge1990}. %(REF something about the deg products or many secondary reactions) \cite{gun'ko2014}

%[Move this bit to the literature review if appropriate:%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%]
Storage conditions such as the choice of wetting solvent, temperature, pressure, humidity, as well as fluctuations in these conditions over time, also contribute to the spectrum of products evolved. A practical application is the propellant stored under a pilot's seat for ejection from the cockpit during emergencies\cite{MinistryofDefence2001,SBIR2013}. During the lifetime of the propellant, it will endure a great number of flights, each involving variable temperature and pressure cycles. The propellant device will include an \ac{EM}:plasticiser:stabiliser mixture that adheres to established industry safety standards. This will incorporate a conservative estimation of the shelf-life and stability of the formulation under different environmental and storage conditions (figure \ref{fig:cartridge}). 
Understanding of the ageing reactions will shed light on the possible interactions between the \ac{EM} and the stabilising mixture, informing better industrial practices, safety standards and product formulations with improved estimates of service life.

In addition to environmental factors and contaminants, the degradation properties of \ac{NC} depend on the primary, secondary and tertiary polymer chain structure.
These properties are largely defined by the cellulose feedstock (figure \ref{fig:fibre}). \acs{SEM} images of \textit{Miscanthus} cellulose following nitration show a bloating of the cellulose fibres, with almost full retention of the fibre structure integrity (figure \ref{fig:miscanthus} ).
%More detail about the following in the literature review. 
Hydrogen bonding networks determine the supramoleular arrangement of the cellulose polysaccharide chains, and variation leads to a mixture of crystalline and amorphous regions\cite{Nishiyama2002,Nishiyama2003}. 
Regions of crystallinity are more difficult to penetrate by solvent, thus are more resistant to hydrolytic decomposition methods; amorphous regions are more porous, exhibit less hydrogen bonding, and are more prone to digestion by both microbes and chemicals\cite{chundawat2011}. %REF
%also, any info on which types of cellulose have shorter/ longer chains, and are more / less suscpetible to certain types of degradation?

\end{figure}

Shukla \textit{et al.} truncated the polymer structure to a single-ring monomer for the purposes of investigating the alkaline hydrolysis behaviour of \ac{NC}\cite{Shukla2012}.
The study analysed the \acs{sn2} nucleophilic attack at the nitrate-carbon site, leading to release of the nitrate ion in favour of a hydroxyl group (figure \ref{fig:C2_C3_C6}). Findings suggested that denitration via alkaline hydrolysis starting from a fully nitrated monomer followed a sequence of C3$\rightarrow$C2$\rightarrow$C6. 
Later studies applying the same reaction to the dimer and trimer found that the sequence instead followed C3$\rightarrow$C6$\rightarrow$C2\cite{Shukla2012a} for the larger systems. %The sequence of nitration and denitration is explored in \ref{chapterlabel4}
Comparisons between the monomer, dimer and trimer found the dimeric structure to be the minimum repeat unit encompassing all bonding and non-bonding interactions, and the smallest acceptable model to accurately demonstrate the denitration behaviour of the polymer. This can be attributed to the 1$\rightarrow$4 glycosidic linkage between each of the $\beta$-D-glucopyranose rings. The angle of the glycosidic oxygen leads to an alternating, non-planar orientation for each additional ring added (figure \ref{fig:models}). The unique interactions between the alternate rings are represented in the dimer and trimer, but lacking in the monomer. 

%The addition of a second ring generates further interactions between the rings within a dimer, than if the chain consisted of solely monomer repeat units. 
%for implementation in molecular dynamics simulations, this is also observed.

In this chapter, the electronic properties of the monomer, dimer and trimer truncations of the \ac{NC} polymer are compared. The most suitable model for subsequent investigations is determined with consideration for accurate representation of the chemistry of the full system, alongside conservation of computational effort% during the exploratory phase of the study
. Hydroxyl  (-OH) and methoxy  (-OCH\textsubscript{3}) capping groups are tested at chain ends in the C1, C4 positions, to explore their interaction with the glucopyranose rings and effect on the distribution of charge on the chosen model.

%The fully nitrated dimer structure used in this study consists of two non-planar $\beta$-D-glucopyranose rings joined by a glycosidic bond, with six nitrate groups attached at the 2,3,6 positions on each ring (FIG XX). 
%
%NOTE%% ESP surface was calculated using the Gaussian charges, not AIM. I'm not sure whether AIM ones are better, or whether the ones I used from G09 were simply based off Mulliken. I don't think so , but Milliken is poor, esp with diffuse functions (I also don't know why this is). So this might all be rubbish.
%
\subsection{Geometry optimisation}

%The monomer starting structure was constructed from the geometry used by Shukla \textit{et. al.} (REF). 
Monomer, dimer and trimer structures were constructed with side chains as closely matching literature orientations as possible. Units were capped with either methoxy or hydroxyl groups, followed by \ac{QM} geometry optimisation.  For dimer and trimer structures, individual glucopyranose rings were appended to the first ring in a 1$\rightarrow$4 position, with alternating planarity (figure \ref{fig:models}). 
In some instances, it was found that the final optimised geometries varied according to the input starting geometry. In the cases of more than one possible converged geometry for the same species, the conformer with lowest absolute energy was chosen. 

Select dimer and trimer molecules were pre-optimised with a \ac{MM} geometry optimisation using UFF or MMFF94 forcefields to determine whether any improvements could be achieved with respect to identification of the global minimum structure or reduction of \ac{QM} optimisation time. 
%To see whether they helped i finding the global minimum easier / sped up optimisation.
Following \ac{MM} pre-optimisation, the dimer cases did not show any noteable speed-up or increase in convergence success during optimisation, or any significant difference in the final optimised geometry. Further investigations did not implement \ac{MM} pre-optimisation for dimer geometries. 
%also, conversion of file formats was timely and labour intensive, with some loss of bonding in formation that had to be restored later on - had to re-draw in nitrate bonds at times.
Optimisation of trimer geometries posed more challenging, oftentimes with convergence failure. Pre-optimisation of the bi-methoxy capped trimer structure generated a reasonable starting input geometry for \ac{QM} optimisation.  This enabled convergence of a final structure, and reduced the number of steps required.
However, it was found that a trimer input geometry derived from an already-optimised dimer structure, with duplication of the first ring and addition to the end of the chain, provided a lower energy conformer and more stable optimisation procedure. Thus, rather than construction of a new trimer geometry ''from scratch'', the trimer structures used in this study were constructed from extension of the fully optimised dimer structures.

\subsection{Labelling system}
\label{sect:labellingsystem}

The numbering scheme for structures is detailed in figure \ref{fig:labelling}. Counting from the oxygen of the first glucopyranose ring as atom 1 (O1), the numbering of carbons proceeds in a clockwise direction following the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules\cite{Cahn1966}. For simplicity, the nitrate groups are numbered 1 - 3, also moving clockwise around the ring. The oxygen linking the nitrate to the polysaccharide backbone is labelled (Ox). Oxygen on the terminal ends of the nitrate group are labelled (Ot). Identical oxygen labelling is applied across all nitrate groups. Labels are given from the largest structure to the smallest: [ring; moiety; attached atoms]. For example, a terminal oxygen (Ot) on the nitrate at the C6 position (N3) of the second ring (R2), would be referred to as R2N3Ot. When referring to only the nitrogen of this nitrate, the label would be R2N3. For the carbon at the C6 position on the second ring, the label would be R2C6.

\newline
	The nitrate oxygen on the terminating ends are referred to as (Ot), and the nitrate oxygen connected to the glucopyranose ring is referred to as (Ox). }

\end{figure}

\subsection{System size and chain ends}
In order to investigate the influence of different capping groups, the fully nitrated dimer structure was used as a reference, following the minimum complete structure approximation established by Shukla \textit{et al.}. %suitable for accurate reproduction of wider system behaviour  (as per Shukla, above). %REF if necessary
Chain ends were capped with methoxy groups, or a combination of a methoxy and a hydroxyl groups (figure \ref{fig:capping-groups-all}). The differences in charge distribution and the nature of intra-molecular interactions were probed using \ac{QTAIM} and analysis of the \ac{ESP} around the molecule.
When considering the system size, the \ac{ESP} and \ac{QTAIM} topology analyses were compared across monomer, dimer and trimer models. Nitration was limited to C2 sites, to explore interactions at lower levels of nitration and to simplifiy the optimisation of the trimer structure. The monomer was nitrated only at C2, the dimer nitrated only at R1C2 and the trimer nitrated at R1C2 and R3C2.
%
%With increasing nitration level, hydroxyl groups were substituted by nitrate groups at the C2, C3 and C6 positions in reverse order of denitration according to the study by Shukla \textit{et al.}\cite{Shukla2012a},  C2$\rightarrow$C6$\rightarrow$C3. The original conformation was conserved; equatorial in the case of C2 and C3.

%A bit of extra detail practical implementation of the partial charges, ESP and lapacian

%Structures underwent geometry optimisation in vacuum and implicit solvent, using various methods detailed in section XX.

%Reasons why I woudn't put it in a perdioci system - 
% I am only looking local chemical reactions at this stage. Though these reactions happen all along the structure, in theory, as I am trying to probe individual reactions that do not yet affect the wider chain, it woudl be a waste of computational effort to model the rest of the chain, when I could see probe the reaction using a smaller segement.

% The NC system isn't periodic in the same way that solid state materials are - the chains twist and bend. Whilst duplicating the same periodic box would allow me to expand the interactions to wider parts of the system, it would still not capture all the behvaiours - sterics, alternate configurations. 
% I would still just be replicating the chemistry that I see with the smaller model. 
% I'd need molecular dynamics for the wider description of the chain. And if I wanted to look at wider chemical interactions - I'd need ab intio MD, which is expensive.
% This would be useful for later probing the wider impact of the products of first stage degradation, to see how the products that are more likely to migrate further into the NC matrix will interact. But whilst I'm still looking at initial denitration, the smaller model will suffice. 

\subsection{Computational details} %TECHNICAL DETAILS OF YOUR SETUP%%%%%%
The \ac{B3LYP} was chosen for initial exploration of electronic properties of the system. It is an efficient and extensively benchmarked method %for calculating electronic properties 
for main group elements and appropraite for the current model system size, where the largest trimer extends to 76 atoms\cite{bento2005,Tirado-Rives2008}. 
%\subsubsection{Geometry optimisation}
All electronic structure calculations in this section, including geometry optimisation and thermodynamic calculations were performed in vacuum to the level of \acs{B3LYP}\/ 6-311+G(d,p) with tight convergence criteria (table \ref{tab:convergence}). Minima were located using the Berny optimisation algorithm\cite{Schlegel1982}, implimented in the \ac{G09} quantum chemistry suite\cite{frisch2013}.

Structures were built using %z-matrix notation or 
the \ac{GView} graphical user interface. Molden 5.0.2 and \ac{GView} packages were used for visualisation. Avogadro molecular editor was used for \ac{MM} pre-optimisation\cite{hanwell2012}. UFF or MMFF94 forcefields were applied with Steepest Descent algorithm\cite{Cauchy1847,Meza2010} and 500 steps.% and convergence of 10e\textsuperscript{-7}.
\acs{ESP} was mapped to the electron density, extracted from the \ac{G09} formatted checkpoint file following optimisation. \acs{ESP} maps were visualised using \ac{GView}, using the CubeGen utility. Density and \ac{ESP} cubes were generated with 80\textsuperscript{3} point grids. 
\ac{QTAIM} topological analyses including %generation of Laplacian electron density maps and 
\ac{CP} analysis on the optimised structures were performed using MultiWFN 3.6.  %REF (also update your diagrams).


%Partial charges were obtained via PyRed (R.E.D. Server version 3.0).

Dimers with \acs{DOS}=3 were bi-capped with methoxy (\acs{CH3CH3}), methoxy-hydroxy (\acs{CH3OH}) or hydroxy-methoxy (\acs{OHCH3}) groups at C1 and C4 positions (figure \ref{fig:capping-groups-all}).

\end{figure}

The properties of all capping group combinations and the effect on the dimer molecule was compared. The methoxy group was expected to provide a more chemically and sterically accurate proxy for the extended polysaccharide, though the hydroxyl capping group has demonstrated wider usage in literature. %REF and validate your next sentence. What other similar systems has it been used on?
 This may be due to its smaller atomic radius which minimises distortion to the wider structure of the model and limits the introduction of artificial steric effects. The hydrogen of the hydroxyl remains relatively chemically benign and it can be argued that it corresponds to polysaccharide chain endings. % resf? and at slightly lower computational cost. [bit of a weak sentence] non-reducing end?

The topology analysis of all dimers revealed notable intermolecular interaction across the two rings, in particular where the C6 side chain is able to interact with the nearest nitrate group on the opposite ring. All three capping group combinations exhibited similar characteristics; nuclear critial points (\acs{NCP}) lay at all atomic sites and each chemical bond was described by a \ac{BCP}. Ring critical points (\acs{RCP}) lay at ring centres and at concentrated points of steric interference within side chain moieties. A single \ac{CCP} was observed in the region between R1C5 - R1C6 - R2N2, where the arrangement of the side chains formed a pseudo cage-like environment  (table \ref{tab:table_cp}).

Hydrogen bonding was observed between within the nitrate groups directly connected to the ring and their associated $\alpha$-hydrogens (figure \ref{fig:alpha}). N1 and N2 nitrates are orientated in the eclipsed conformation relative to the  $\alpha$-hydrogen, bringing the terminal nitrate oxygen within H-bonding distance and generating a steric critical point between the oxygen and $\alpha$-hydrogen (table \ref{tab:Hconformation}). 
This was not the case for C6 nitrates, which are not directly connected to the ring. The flexbility of the C6 alkyl chain allows for relaxation of the nitrate to the gauche orientation, relative to the \ce{CH2} group. The increased distance between the terminal oxygen of the nitrate and the $\alpha$-hydrogens exceeded H-bonding distance and reduced steric crowding.% in the region.

Inter-ring H-bonding occurred between C6 hydrogens and the terminal oxygens of the nearest nitrate on the other ring, in addition to N - O interactions and O - O interactions. 
%For ring 1, the interaction was between R1C6H and R2N2Ot, and for ring 2, between R1N1Ot and R2C6H.
Upon replacement of a hydroxyl capping group for a bulkier methoxy, the geometry of the nitrate groups adjust to accommodate. It can be seen in the case of \acs{CH3CH3} in figure \ref{fig:cp-all}.a), that there is an additional \ac{BCP} and intramolecular bonding path between R1N1Ot and R2N3Ot that was not present in the structures with only one methoxy group, %QTAIM / Laplacian to find out the nature of this interaction?
 and an R1O1 - R2N2 interaction that is not present in \acs{OHCH3}. 
Inspection of nitrate-nitrate distances show that with substition to methoxy capping groups, the inter-nitrate distances did not change significantly (table \ref{tab:geomety_cap}).

%Here I want to comment on the interaction with diff cappign groups - why do I continue with CH3?
%Does this segway into something about the model size in the next section?
Topology analysis on dimers with lower levels of nitration (\acs{DOS}=2) show an interaction between unsubstituted hydroxyl side chains with the capping group on ring 1 (figure \ref{fig:2_0}). 
% Whilst not directly analogous with the H-bonding between the hydrogen of the C6 and the glycosidic oxygen seen in glucose \cite{Jebber1996}, it can be seen that the interaction of side chains with the polymeric oyxgen is present in other sugar structures. 
\ac{NC} dimers nitrated at only the R1C2 position exhibit H-bonding and H-H interaction between the capping group hydrogens and those of C6, and O-O interactions between R1O1 and hydroxyl oxygens at R2C3. %and C6 in the case of CH3CH3 and CH3OH dimers. 
The variation in interaction site is dependent on the geometry. Changes in the capping group partially influence the change of geometry around the interacting sites (table \ref{tab:tortion}). %, though the site of nitration is most crucial.
%In the case of the R1C2 dimers, the change in orientation of the rings does not give any indication of angle or bonds.

%On comparing surfaces - you need to compare ESPs directly, rather than visually (this is last resort) - you need a table. These aren't the same as partial charges. Can I get them from the cube files? 

The \ac{ESP} maps % for the bi-capped methoxy dimer (\ac{CH3CH3}), methoxy-hydroxy capped dimer (\ac{CH3OH}) and hydroxy-methoxy capped dimer (\ac{OHCH3}) 
represent the charge density around the molecule (figure \ref{fig:ESP}). A more negative value (increasingly red) indicates an area of higher electron density, whilst a more positive value (increasingly blue) indicates an area of lower electron density. It can be seen that the areas with lowest electron density lie around the centre of the glucopyranose rings and at the C6 position of the side branches. This can be explained by the number of adjacent oxygens drawing the electron density away from the less electronegative %but electron-rich INDUCTIVE EFFECT: polarisation of a sigma bond due to differences in electronegativity - either electron donating or withdrawing. 
alkyl groups. The most electron rich areas are the outermost oxygens of the nitrate groups (Ot positions). The terminal oxygens draw electron density from the nitrogen lone pairs and are resonance stabilised. %could be BS
The presence of the hydroxyl capping group promotes a small decrease in the concentration of electron density around the adjacent ring. This is illustrated by the slight deepening of the blue shading around the ring directly bonded to the hydroxyl. The hydroxy group itself presents the lowest concentration of electron density, suggesting that the terminating hydrogen would be suceptible to nucleophilic attack. 
For the extended polymer, it is expected that each glycosidic oxygen presents a similar electron-density profile. The oxygen of both methoxy and hydroxy capping groups exhibit a lower concentration of electron density than that of the bridging oxygen between the two rings. 
This deficiency is particularly pronouced in the case of the hydroxyl group, suggesting that the methoxy group provides a more representative approximation for the extended polymer with respect to charge density. 
 %reinforced by partial charges?
%The trimer model's ESPs should reinforce that CH3 is a more chemically similar approximation - no concentration of charge 

%Shukla’s work identified the nitrate group attached to carbon three (C3) as the most susceptible to denitration and the first to be removed. This is supported by the distribution of partial charges in the molecule, with disregard of the capping groups. %Thus, the nitrate group on C3 was used as the target site for degradation studies.

% Want to say that partial charges / ESP / Laplacian / CP's do not look so different, across each of the model systems, but that the dimer is the best model for capturing all the interactions based on the payoff between computational efficiency and accuracy of resutls. The interaction between the rings is missing for the monomer, and this is a crucial aspect of the chemistry. 

The electrostatic potential and topology analysis of a mononer, dimer and trimer were compared in order to explore the limitations of each truncation. % and determine which model to proceed with further investigations.

Analysis of the \acs{BCP}s in the monomer reveal steric centres, a single non-bonding interaction with the capping group, and a terminal oxygen - $\alpha$-hydrogen interaction at the nitrate, as were seen in previous systems (figure \ref{fig:monomer_top}).
The trimer model is nitrated at only R1C2 and R3C2 sites. The unit displays a more extensive network of hydrogen bonds between rings, facilitated by the higher number of unsubstituted hydroxyl groups on the second ring (figure \ref{fig:trimer_top}).
Compared with the dimer and trimer models, the monomer presents all the intra-ring interactions observed in the larger units, but does not possess inter-ring interactions, as would be expected due to the absence of additional glucopyranose rings.  

Though Mulliken charges are highly variable with basis set and the inclusion of diffuse functions, they may offer a general overview of the relative partial charge distribution in the molecule. Figure \ref{fig:mulliken} and table \ref{tab:mulliken} display the Mulliken charges of each of the different sized models. The large difference in charges for the C1 capping oxygen between monomer and the larger models is due to the absence of a second connected ring. Carbon sites within the glucopyranose ring present the greatest variation between each model. 
Attention to the changes in orientation of the side chains offer explanation for the observed charge distribution. The orientation of the C4 capping group is slightly altered for the dimer, as compared to the monomer and trimer, leading to the more negative charge at C4 for the dimer. % of the C6 hydroxyl group also  
The geometry of the C2 nitrate is also most similar for the monomer and trimer, explaining the contrast between the charge concentration at C2 for these two species and the dimer. The Mulliken charges are therefore extremely sensitive to fine alterations in the geometry and should not be taken as a reliable measure for the charge distribution.

%Mulliken charges are made worse by diffuse basis functions. Appaz AIM is more reliable.
Whilst the monomer lacks the essential interactions between rings and side chains present in the polymer, when exploring the chemistry of a localised group of atoms - such as in the case of the denitration reaction - it is a suitable approximation for a primary investigation into the mechanistic details at the reaction site. The validated mechanisms can then be applied to the dimer and wider systems to re-introduce ring-ring interactions and higher steric effects.

%If the other trimer I get has a similar energy but completely different geomtry, can tabulate it and comment on how many degrees of freedom - difficult to find local minimum, even with initial MM optimisation. This counts for dimer too


\section{Summary}
In this section the polymer structure of \ac{NC} was truncated to a system size suitable for application of density functional theory, for use in subsequent investigation into the decomposition mechanisms. Methoxy and hydroxyl capping group aproximations were compared. \ac{ESP} maps showed that the methoxy group exhibited a charge density more similar to polymer chain units than that of the hydroxyl group. Topological analysis using \ac{QTAIM} highlighted non-bonding interactions between both hydroxyl and methoxy chain endings with side chains of the dimer. Findings showed that the methoxy capping group provided a more sterically and chemically accurate approximaion for the extended polymer, and will be adopted for work in further chapters.

Topological analysis of monomer, dimer and trimer models found that the 2-ring and 3-ring systems were the most consistent %with chemistry of the polysaccharide, 
with respect to pattern of charge density and intramolecular interactions. It was assumed that the largest model would be most representative of the polysaccharide, as suggested in by Shukla \textit{et al.}\cite{Shukla2012a}.
%This suggested that the larger models were more representative of the wider polymer. %%%%%%%%%%
Further studies will probe the chemistry at individual nitrate sites on the ring. 
Despite the absence of inter-ring non-bonding interactions, the monomer model was deemed sufficient for initial investigations into the chemistry of \ac{NC}. Medium-to-long range interactions are of less significance during these initial mechanistic investigations at localised sites, and the time saving in exploring a more complex \ac{PES} would be significant as compared to the larger models. 
This is of particular importance when considering transition state searches and reaction-complex geometry optimisations. The exclusion of secondary non-bonding iteractions %from the additional sites on larger models, 
and reduction in the degrees of freedom due to truncation of the model size, will simplify and speed-up structure searches and identification of the \ac{MEP} from reactants to products. Thus the monomer model will be used for further studies involving single-site reaction mechanisms and transition state searching.

%When considering electroststic potential and to a lesser extent steric considerations, methoxy groups were found to provide a better approximation for the extended polysaccharide with respect to both electronic and geometric properties.
