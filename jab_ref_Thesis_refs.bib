  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the extension of the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) to a much broader range of organic systems. It also describes a preliminary parameterization of MMFF94 for the hydronium and hydroxide ions and for various halide, alkalai, and alkalai earth ions as well as for such “protein” metals as Zn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Cu+, Fe2+, and Fe3+. The extension employed computational data on charge distributions, molecular geometries, and conformational energies for a series of oxysulfur (particularly sulfonamide) and oxyphosphorous compounds and for a diverse set of small molecules and ions not covered in the core parameterization. It also employed experimental data for approximately 2800 good-quality structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Some of the additional computational data were used to extend the explicit parameterization of electrostatic interactions and to more widely define a useful additive approximation for the “bond polarity” parameters (bond charge increments) used in MMFF94. Both the experimental and computational data served to define reference bond lengths and angles that the extended force field uses in conjunction with force constants obtained from carefully calibrated empirical rules. The extended torsion parameters consist partly of explicit parameters derived to reproduce MP2/6-31G* conformational energies and partly of “default parameters” provided by empirical rules patterned after those used in DREIDING and UFF but calibrated, where possible, against computationally derived MMFF94 torsion parameters. Comparisons to experimental data show that MMFF94 reproduces crystallographic bond lengths and bond angles with relatively modest root mean square (rms) deviations of approx. 0.02 Å and 2°, respectively. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for conformational energies, rotational barriers, and equilibrium torsion angles. It describes the derivation of the torsion parameters from high-quality computational data and characterizes MMFF94's ability to reproduce both computational and experimental data, the latter particularly in relation to MM3. The computational data included: (i) ∼ 250 comparisons of conformational energy based on “MP4SDQ/TZP” calculations (triple-zeta plus polarization calculations at a defined approximation to the highly correlated MP4SDQ level) at MP2/6-31G* geometries; and (ii) ∼ 1200 MP2/TZP comparisons of “torsion profile” structures at geometries derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries. The torsion parameters were derived in restrained least-squares fits that used the complete set of available computational data, thereby ensuring that a fully optimal set of parameters would be obtained. The final parameters reproduce the “MP4SDQ/TZP” and MP2/TZP computational data with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.31 and 0.50 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces a set of 37 experimental gas-phase and solution conformational energies, enthalpies, and free energies with a rms deviation of 0.38 kcal/mol; for comparison, the “MP4SDQ/TZP” calculations and MM3 each gives a rms deviation of 0.37 kcal/mol. Furthermore, MMFF94 reproduces 28 experimentally determined rotational barriers with a rms deviation of 0.39 kcal/mol. Given the diverse nature of the experimental conformational energies and rotational barriers and the clear indications of experimental error in some cases, the MMFF94 results appear excellent. Nevertheless, MMFF94 encounters somewhat greater difficulty in handling multifunctional compounds that place highly polar functional groups in close proximity, probably because it, like other commonly used force fields, too greatly simplifies the description of electrostatic interactions. Some suggestions for enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are discussed. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article defines the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for intermolecular interactions. It specifies the novel “buffered” functional forms used for treating van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interactions, and describes the use of : (1) high quality ab initio data to parameterize vdW interactions involving aliphatic hydrogens; and (2) HF/6-31G* calculations on hydrogen-bonded complexes to parameterize nonbonded interactions in polar systems. Comparisons show that appropriate trends in the HF/6-31G* data are well reproduced by MMFF94 and that intermolecular interaction energies and geometries closely parallel those given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. A proper balance between solvent–solvent, solvent–solute, and solute–solute interactions, critically important for prospective success in aqueous simulations, thus appears to be attained. Comparison of MMFF94, OPLS, CHELPG electrostatic potential fit, QEq, Gasteiger, and Abraham charges for 20 small molecules and ions also shows the close correspondence between MMFF94 and OPLS. As do OPLS and all current, widely used force fields, MMFF94 employs “effective pair potentials” which incorporate in an averaged way the increases in polarity which occur in high dielectric media. Some limitations of this approach are discussed and suggestions for possible enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are noted. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94 for molecular geometries and deformations. It defines the form used for the valence-coordinate terms that represent variations in bond lengths and angles, and it describes the derivation of quadratic force constants from HF/6-31G* data and the derivation of reference bond lengths and angles from fits to MP2/6-31G*-optimized geometries. Comparisons offered show that MMFF94 accurately reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization and demonstrate that its derivation from such data simultaneously confers the ability to reproduce experiment. In particular, MMFF94 reproduces experimentally determined bond lengths and angles for 30 organic molecules with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.014 Å and 1.2°, respectively. MM3 reproduces bond angles to the same accuracy, but reproduces experimental bond lengths more accurately, in part because it was fit directly to thermally averaged experimental bond lengths; MMFF94, in contrast, was fit to (usually shorter) energy-minimum values, as is proper for an anharmonic force field intended for use in molecular-dynamics simulations. The comparisons also show that UFF and a recent version of CHARMm (QUANTA 3.3 parameterization) are less accurate for molecular geometries than either MMFF94 or MM3. For vibrational frequencies, MMFF94 and MM3 give comparable overall rms deviations versus experiment of 61 cm−1 and 57 cm−1, respectively, for 15 small, mostly organic molecules. In a number of instances, MM3's derivation employed observed frequencies that differ substantially—by nearly 400 cm−1 in one case—from other published frequencies which had themselves been confirmed theoretically by good-quality ab initio calculations. Overall, the comparisons to experimental geometries and vibrational frequencies demonstrate that MMFF94 achieves MM3-like accuracy for organic systems for which MM3 has been parameterized. Because MMFF94 is derived mainly from computational data, however, it has been possible to parameterize MMFF94 with equal rigor for a wide variety of additional systems for which little or no useful experimental data exist. Equally good performance can be expected for such systems. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Both the direct and angular attacks of OH− in the hydrolysis reactions were considered. Geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level both in the gas phase and in bulk water solution. Effect of bulk water solution was modeled using the PCM approach. Nature of potential energy surfaces of the local minima and transition states was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were also performed to validate the computed transition state structures. Effect of electron correlation on computed energies was considered at the MP2/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. It was found that the angular attack of OH− in the hydrolysis reaction will require significantly larger activation energy than the direct attack. Computed transition states correspond to the structure where the presence of hydrogen bonds between the OH− and various sites of nitrocellulose was the necessary stabilizing factor. The ring breaking through the C-O ring bond was not found to be the first step in the alkaline hydrolysis reactions. It was predicted that alkaline hydrolysis would be driven by the addition-elimination (substitution) reaction starting at the C3 site and will progress in the C2 → C6 direction. Entropy of system in water solution will have profound effect on alkaline hydrolysis reaction of nitrocellulose.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Multiwfn is a multifunctional program for wavefunction analysis. Its main functions are: (1) Calculating and visualizing real space function, such as electrostatic potential and electron localization function at point, in a line, in a plane or in a spatial scope. (2) Population analysis. (3) Bond order analysis. (4) Orbital composition analysis. (5) Plot density-of-states and spectrum. (6) Topology analysis for electron density. Some other useful utilities involved in quantum chemistry studies are also provided. The built-in graph module enables the results of wavefunction analysis to be plotted directly or exported to high-quality graphic file. The program interface is very user-friendly and suitable for both research and teaching purpose. The code of Multiwfn is substantially optimized and parallelized. Its efficiency is demonstrated to be significantly higher than related programs with the same functions. Five practical examples involving a wide variety of systems and analysis methods are given to illustrate the usefulness of Multiwfn. The program is free of charge and open-source.

  abstract  = {We have computed consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the anti-E2, syn-E2, and SN2 pathways of X− + CH3CH2X with X = F and Cl. This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). The ab initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) < SN2 (X = F) < SN2 (X = Cl) ∼ syn-E2 (X = F) < anti-E2 (X = Cl) < syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F− + CH3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl− + CH3CH2Cl, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway. Best overall agreement with our ab initio benchmark is obtained by representatives from each of the three categories of functionals, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid DFT, with mean absolute errors in, for example, central barriers of 4.3 (OPBE), 2.2 (M06-L), and 2.0 kcal/mol (M06), respectively. Importantly, the hybrid functional BHandH and the meta-GGA M06-L yield incorrect trends and qualitative features of the PESs (in particular, an erroneous preference for SN2 over the anti-E2 in the case of F− + CH3CH2F) even though they are among the best functionals as measured by their small mean absolute errors of 3.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol in reaction barriers. OLYP and B3LYP have somewhat higher mean absolute errors in central barriers (5.6 and 4.8 kcal/mol, respectively), but the error distribution is somewhat more uniform, and as a consequence, the correct trends are reproduced.},

  abstract  = {Abstract To obtain a set of consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PES) for the two archetypal nucleophilic substitution reactions of the chloride anion at carbon in chloromethane (SN2@C) and at silicon in chlorosilane (SN2@Si), we have explored these PESes using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [HF, MP2, MP4SDQ, CCSD, CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of six Gaussian-type basis sets, up to g polarization. Relative energies of stationary points are converged to within 0.01 to 0.56 kcal/mol as a function of the basis-set size. Our best estimate, at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ, for the relative energies of the [Cl?, CH3Cl] reactant complex, the [Cl?CH3?Cl]? transition state and the stable [Cl?SiH3?Cl]? transition complex is ?10.42, +2.52, and ?27.10 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, we have investigated the performance for these reactions of four popular density functionals, namely, BP86, BLYP, B3LYP, and OLYP, in combination with a large doubly polarized Slater-type basis set of triple-? quality (TZ2P). Best overall agreement with our CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ benchmark is obtained with OLYP and B3LYP. However, OLYP performs better for the SN2@C overall and central barriers, which it underestimates by 2.65 and 4.05 kcal/mol, respectively. The other DFT approaches underestimate these barriers by some 4.8 (B3LYP) to 9.0 kcal/mol (BLYP). ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 26: 1497?1504, 2005},

The focus is comparison of computed and experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition, the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the 622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation are 3.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 kcal/mol for B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction. A diverse set of 34 isomerizations highlights specific issues of general interest, such as performance on differences in steric effects, conjugation, and bonding. The corresponding MAEs for the isomerizations are 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol. Improvement is obtained for isomerizations of amines and alcohols when both polarization and diffuse functions are used, but the overstabilization of linear alkanes compared to branched isomers can be relieved only with the dispersion correction. Besides the insights on DFT methods, the study also aimed to quantify the gains in accuracy that can be achieved by replacing energetics from NDO-based semiempirical methods with DFT results. Since the MAEs obtained with the PDDG/PM3 method for the 622 heats of formation and 34 isomerizations are 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, negligible advantage in accuracy for the B3LYP-based methods emerged in the absence of the dispersion corrections.},

Nanocelluloses in particular show great promise as a cost-effective advanced material for biomedical applications because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cytotoxicity. Moreover, with their chemical functionality they can be easily modified to yield useful products. While nature uses the hierarchical nanostructure of cellulose as the load-bearing constituent in plants, a significant amount of research has been directed toward the fabrication of advanced cellulosic materials with various nanostructures and functional properties. Such nanocelluloses are widely applied in medical implants, tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound healing, diagnostics, and other medical applications with real examples in this field. There are also emerging fields being developed to use nanocelluloses and their composites in more novel ways in biomedical applications such as 3D printing and magnetically responsive materials. In this mini-review, recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanocellulose-based materials and composites are presented with a special emphasis on their suitability for material requirements for biomedical applications as well as the new directions and challenges that the materials might face in the future.},

  abstract  = {Conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels is partly inefficient due to the deleterious impact of cellulose crystallinity on enzymatic saccharification. We demonstrate how the synergistic activity of cellulases was enhanced by altering the hydrogen bond network within crystalline cellulose fibrils. We provide a molecular-scale explanation of these phenomena through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enzymatic assays. Ammonia transformed the naturally occurring crystalline allomorph Iβ to IIII, which led to a decrease in the number of cellulose intrasheet hydrogen bonds and an increase in the number of intersheet hydrogen bonds. This rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within cellulose IIII, which increased the number of solvent-exposed glucan chain hydrogen bonds with water by ∼50%, was accompanied by enhanced saccharification rates by up to 5-fold (closest to amorphous cellulose) and 60-70% lower maximum surface-bound cellulase capacity. The enhancement in apparent cellulase activity was attributed to the “amorphous-like” nature of the cellulose IIII fibril surface that facilitated easier glucan chain extraction. Unrestricted substrate accessibility to active-site clefts of certain endocellulase families further accelerated deconstruction of cellulose IIII. Structural and dynamical features of cellulose IIII, revealed by MD simulations, gave additional insights into the role of cellulose crystal structure on fibril surface hydration that influences interfacial enzyme binding. Subtle alterations within the cellulose hydrogen bond network provide an attractive way to enhance its deconstruction and offer unique insight into the nature of cellulose recalcitrance. This approach can lead to unconventional pathways for development of novel pretreatments and engineered cellulases for cost-effective biofuels production.},

Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-β-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3 → C6 → C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

  abstract = {Five water molecules were placed in 37 different configurations around α- and β-d-glucopyranose in the gt, gg, and tg conformational states, and the glucose-water complexes were geometry optimized using density functionals at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory. The five water molecules were organized in space and energy minimized using an empirical potential, AMB02C, and then further geometry optimized using DFT algorithms to minimum energy positions. Electronic energy, zero point vibrational energy, enthalpy, entropy, stress energy on glucose and the water cluster, hydrogen-bond energy, and relative free energy were obtained for each configuration using thermodynamic procedures and an analytical Hessian program. The lowest energy complex was that of a clustering of water molecules around the 1- and 6-hydroxyl positions of the β-gt anomer. Configurations in which the water molecules created a favorable network completely around and under glucose were found to have low energy for both α and β anomers. Calculation of the α/β anomeric ratio using the zero point corrected energy gave, ∼32/68%, highly favoring the β anomer in agreement with the experimental ∼36/64% value. This ratio is better than the ∼50/50% ratio found in our previous monohydrate study. An approximate hydroxymethyl population was obtained by noting average relative energies among the three conformational states, gt, gg, and tg. In the β anomer complexes the gt conformation was favored over the gg state, while in the α anomer complexes the gg state was favored over the gt conformation, with the tg conformations all being of higher energy making little or no contribution to the rotamer population. Some geometry variances, found between glucose in vacuo and glucose after interaction with water molecules, are described and account for some observed C-5-C-6 bond length anomalies reported by us previously for the vacuum glucose structures.},

  abstract = {Twenty-six monohydrates of α- and β-d-glucopyranose were studied using gradient methods at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory. Geometry optimization was carried out with the water molecules at different configurations around the glucose molecule. A new nomenclature for hydrated carbohydrates was developed to describe the water configurations. Zero-point vibrational energy, enthalpy, entropy, and relative free energy were obtained using the harmonic approximation. Hydrogen-bond energies for the monohydrates range from ∼−5 to −12kcal/mol, and the average relative free energy is ∼5kcal/mol. The 1-hydroxy position is the most energetically favored site for hydration, and the region between the two and three positions is the next-most favored site. A water molecule approaching α-d-glucose between the 1- and 2-hydroxy positions pulls the 2-hydroxyl hydrogen atom away from the 1-hydroxy oxygen atom, thus increasing the hydrogen-bond length and also increasing the α-d-glucose energy. The increase in energy that occurs with a similar interaction on the β-anomer is much less effective since the hydrogen bond is much longer. Using the calculated free energies of all 26 configurations, the anomer population (α/β) increases in the β-anomer population relative to the in vacuo case by ∼10% at the expense of the α-anomer, giving an (α/β) ratio of ∼50/50. This result arises from entropy contributions favoring the β-anomer more than the α-anomer. From analysis of donor and acceptor hydrogen-bond lengths, excellent correlation is found between the DFT calculated distances and those taken from carbohydrate structures in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Bank.},

The resulting functional, ωB97X-D yields satisfactory accuracy for thermochemistry, kinetics, and non-covalent interactions. Tests show that for non-covalent systems, ωB97X-D shows slight improvement over other empirical dispersion-corrected density functionals, while for covalent systems and kinetics it performs noticeably better. Relative to our previous functionals, such as ωB97X, the new functional is significantly superior for non-bonded interactions, and very similar in performance for bonded interactions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A comparative study of intermolecular potential energy curves is performed on the complexes H2O(SINGLE BOND)HF, H2O(SINGLE BOND)H2O, H2O(SINGLE BOND)H2S, and H2S(SINGLE BOND)H2S using nine different basis sets at the MP2 and DFT (BLYP and B3LYP) levels of theory. The basis set superposition error is corrected by means of the counterpoise scheme and based on the ?chemical Hamiltonian approach.? The counterpoise and CHA-corrected DFT curves are generally close to each other. Using small basis sets, the B3LYP functional cannot be favored against the BLYP one because the BLYP results sometimes get closer to the MP2 values than those of B3LYP. From the results?including the available literature data?we suggest that one has to use at least polarized-valence triple-zeta-quality basis sets (TZV, 6-311G) for the investigation of hydrogen-bonded complexes. Special attention must be paid to the physical nature of the binding. If the dispersion forces become significant DFT methods are not able to describe the interaction. Proper correction for the basis set superposition error is found to be mandatory in all cases.?? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.?J Comput Chem 19: 575?584, 1998},
