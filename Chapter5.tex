\section{NC of 12.5\% nitrogen}
\subsection{Diffusion of \ce{NO.}}
Or more NO radical tbh
If we do do NO2+ we want to see it interact with water, more than anything.
As for the radical, cite Lisa's work for the fully nitrated. You can still do the radical with the less that fully nitrated. Also could repeat what Lisa did, since she may have included plasticiser and you don't.
