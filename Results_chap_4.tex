\section{Introduction}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
[Excerpt from Section \ref{chapter4:intro} added above, so the below paragraph makes sense.]

%detailed list of possible reactions products - due to ageing or otherwise listed
Following the initial denitration step, products are evolved as gases or remain in the \ac{NC} matrix. 
%Reactive species include %the acidic products from the elimination of \ce{HNO2} and 
Reactive nitrogen dioxide radicals generated from homolysis of the O-N bond not evolved as \ce{NO2} gas, are likely to migrate within the bulk and attack other sites in the polymer and free species. Nitrous acid released from intramolecular reactions within the polymer contribute to the acidity of the overall system, lowering the pH and further stimulating hydrolysis processes. %(who? et al

The neutral and alkaline hydrolysis reactions follow a pseudo-first order process. The degradation of cellulose also follows a pseudo-first order rate\cite{Calvini2008}.

As described in section \ref{chapter4:intro}, Moniruzzaman \textit{et al.} analysed the reaction of nitrates with anthraquinone dye \acs{SB59} to probe the reactivity at each of the C2, C3 and C6 sites on \ac{NC}, using \ac{UVVIS} and H NMR spectra (figure \ref{fig:SB59_NOx}).
In the study, the presence of secondary reaction products following the liberation of the nitrate group was observed in the \ac{UVVIS} absorption spectra. Samples with longer ageing time presented spectra dominated by consecutive products.

Though figure \ref{fig:SB59_NOx} illustrates the reaction of the dye with NO groups, the study makes no indication of the source of NO\textsubscript{x}, except that they are products of thermolysis of \ac{NC}. Whether these are 

%Discuss the work of Camera, Aellig and Chin 2007

In this section, secondary and extended reaction schemes for the low temperature ageing of \ac{NC} are explored. Mechanisms proposed by Camera \textit{et al.} and Aellig \textit{et al.} are probed to determine the reactions responsible for the experimentally observed degradation products.

\section{Methodology}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The species reactions proposed by Camera and Aellig \textit{et al.} were geometry optimised using \ac{wb97xd}, and \ac{B3LYP} functionals. The reactions were initally modelled using ethyl nitrate as a test system before expansion to the full C2 
monomer. 

\subsection{Computational details}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All geometry optimisations were performed in \ac{G09}, using the \ac{wb97xd} and \ac{B3LYP} functionals. Optimisations were repeated with the \ac{PCM} to introduce solvent effects.

%For an in ital comparison of the methods you used, you could do a diagram like the one Kuklja did (kuja2014.pdf, page 89, fig 3.7).
%She also makes mention of the overestimation of activation barriers for pure DFT methods. Make sure you know the background surrounding this - why does this occur, and what is done to remedy it?
