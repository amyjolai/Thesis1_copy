% Which ones contribute to the end products seen in literature, and which much be consumed in subsequent reactions

\section{Introduction}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Talk about the prevalence and importance of secondary + products. 
% Statement - it is these secondary reactions that do the majority of the decomposition, and breakdown of the polymer such that the experimental observables are produced. 
 %Following the preliminary denitration step, products of intramolecular or hydrolytic nitrate elmination are evolved as gases or remain trapped in the \ac{NC} matrix. 
%The full mechanism of \ac{NC} decomposition is complex. 
Products of the preliminary denitration step of \ac{NC} can be evolved as gases or remain trapped in the polymer matrix. 
%  responsible for spectroscopically observed end products
% IS there any implicit evidence of species being trapped though? Or do they either escape, or continue reacting? Perhaps there is no state of just being “trapped” and latent in the NC matrix.
%
%Reactive species include %the acidic products from the elimination of \ce{HNO2} and 
Reactive nitrogen dioxide radicals generated from homolysis of the O-N bond %not evolved as \ce{NO2} gas, 
are likely to migrate within the bulk and attack other sites on the polysaccharide, initiating branched radical chain reactions. %REF
% and free species  by a radical chain reaction
These lead to deeper decomposition of the polymer \textit{via} 
% at later stages of decomposition
chain scission and rupture of glucose rings, with eventual complete disintegration of the molecule, assisted by products released by ongoing acid hydrolysis. %REF
Nitrous and nitric acids are released directly from denitration or via transformation of released NO\textsubscript{x} species. In addition to catalysing hydrolysis, they increase the acidity of the overall system, lowering the pH and stimulating further hydrolytic processes \cite{Hu2011}.  %Plus the self heating, more bond dissociations, etc. 
%As described in section \ref{chapter4:intro}, Moniruzzaman \textit{et al.} used the reaction of nitrates with an anthraquinone dye (\acs{SB59}) to probe the reactivity at each of the C2, C3 and C6 sites on \ac{NC}, using \acs{UVVis} and \textsuperscript{1}H NMR spectroscopy (figure \ref{fig:SB59_NOx}).
The final product mixture is dictated by the numerous side reactions involving autocatalysis, radical reactions and product interactions. 

When studying the ageing of \ac{NC} using  \acs{UVVis} spectroscopy, Moniruzzaman \textit{et al.} observed %identified 
increasing concentrations of reaction products beyond those generated from first-stage decomposition, following heat treatment over extended timescales %(figure \ref{fig:UV_all})
\cite{Moniruzzaman2008,Moniruzzaman2014}. 
%\acs{UV} absorption of an anthraquinone dye was used to determine the activation energies for the removal of a nitrate. 
The reaction of the \ac{SB59} with NO\textsubscript{x} released by denitration, mimics the action of stabilisers such as \ac{DPA} and \ac{2NDPA} commonly used in \ac{NC} formulations. %REF 
The secondary amine groups of the dye consume any nitrates in the system, eliminating the possibility of successive reactions generating acidic species. %REF

Un-aged \ac{NC} thin films, and films aged at 40\textdegree C, 50\textdegree C, 60\textdegree C and 70\textdegree C for timescales of up to 2000hrs for 40\textdegree C, were compared. 
\acs{UV} absorbances at 600 nm and 650 nm were characteristic of the \ac{SB59} dye used to indicate the presence of NO\textsubscript{x}, released by the denitration of \ac{NC} (figure \ref{fig:UV_all}). The isosbestic point identified at 552 nm showed a proportional relationship between the concentration of \acs{SB59} as it decreased, with the concentration of the [\acs{SB59} + \ac{NC}] product as it increased. % accordingly. %though not necessarily proportionallys
Samples exposed to higher ageing temperatures presented spectra dominated by products formed \textit{via} secondary reactions.  
%the relative concentrations of unreacted \acs{SB59} and \acs{SB59} following reaction with \ac{NC} were proportional.
For samples aged at temperatures $>$40\degree C, the isosbestic point demonstrated a downwards shift with increasing dye consumption. %, until it was eventually lost. 
%This was most clearly illustrated by 
In the case of the 70\degree C treated run, the final measurement (indicated by the royal-blue line in bold in figure \ref{fig:boldUV})) deviated from the isosbestic point entirely, with more than 81\% consumption of the original dye concentration. The drift from the isosbestic point, in addition to the appearance of new absorbance peaks below 400 nm, allude to the presence of new species in the reaction mixture not generated by the primary reaction of \acs{SB59} and \ac{NC}. It is likely that these arise from the continued reaction of \acs{SB59} derivatives with \ac{NC} degradation products, or further derivatives thereof, as suggested in figure \ref{fig:SB59_NOx}.

In the study of \ac{PETN} ageing at high temperatures (115\degree C - 135\degree C) in vacuum, and low temperatures (20\degree C - 65\degree C) in acetonitrile solution, Shepodd \textit{et al.} commented that thermolysis produced a more complex and varied mixture, due to deeper degradation and recombination of radicals \cite{Shepodd1997}.

%(Say something about the thermolyti scheme.)
Termination reactions were not emphasised in either of the schemes for these cases. The hydrolysis scheme was adapted from an earlier work by Camera \textit{et al.} %(first referenced in section \ref{equ:camera_first}%\ref{chapter5:intro}
involving the nitrate ester decomposition and subsequent reactions of \ac{EN} (where R = \ce{CH3CH2} for the scheme above) \cite{Camera1982}. The original study included an expansion of the hydrolysis step (equation \ref{equ:protonation}), where the involvement of \ce{NO2+} was illustrated (scheme \ref{sch:cameraschema_full}).%, first seen in section \ref{chapter5:intro})% is repeated below}.  \\ %pertaining to \ac{EN}:
%\subsection*{Camera's equations}

It was highlighted by Camera, that the oxidation of alcohol by nitric acid (equation \ref{equ:chinH2}) is slow and thus rate-limiting. The mechanism is likely to occur \textit{via} a series of intermediate reactions of which the details are not known.  Following the generation of nitrous acid, subsequent oxidations occur rapidly. %why and how? 
According to Rigas \textit{et al.}, alcohols are more susceptible to wet oxidation than esters \cite{Rigas1997}. A higher concentration of unsubstituted hydroxyl groups in the system, and therefore a fewer nitrate ester groups (or a lower \ac{DOS} value), decreases overall stabililty. % What is the mechanism, and why? This would suggest that below a certain threshold \ac{DOS} value, the oxidation of hydroxyl groups (equation \ref{equ:chinH2}) would dominate over the hydrolytic denitration reaction (equation \ref{equ:chinH2}). therefore indicates that a higher concentration of -OH groups present in the system decreases stabililty. 
% Check that this doesn’t contradict the point made in Chap 2, about the inductive effect of adjacent nitrates on the reactivity/ predisposition to denitrate easier, or if it does, ref the two contrasting papers. 

Equations \ref{equ:chinH3} - \ref{equ:chinH6} describe a possible branched radical chain mechanism, fed by the nitrous and nitric acids produced during the hydrolysis and alchohol oxidation reactions during the initiation stage. By contrast, the propagation reactions in the branched radical chain mechanism for thermolysis are poorly characterised (equation \ref{equ:chinT2}), defined only by the observable products. This is likely due to their rapid and varied nature, rendering it difficult to follow spectroscopically. %REF

Both the Camera/Chin and Aellig schemes above produce final end products observed in the decomposition of \ac{NC}. In particular, Aellig’s scheme accounts for the production of \ce{N2O}, which forms a significant part of the decomposition eluent \cite{Buelow2002}. %Whislt not a full-resolution, exhaustive depiction the full spectrum of reactions that take place in the \ac{NC} matrix during it’s slow ageing, the presented reactions encapsulate the early major reactions of the most prevalent and active species in the system.
Whilst the schemes do not a propose an exhaustive description of the full spectrum of reactions that take place in the \ac{NC} matrix during its slow ageing, the early stage reactions of the key species responsible for decomposition are  encapsulated.
%autocatalytic rate 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FIX / CHECK THIS SECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% confused rates of thermolytic degradation: \cite{brill1997}
	% Despite good understanding about the initial step of the process, the kinetics of thermolysis of NC are complicated by the existence of rapid secondary reactions, autocatalysis, and self-heating. As a result, further kinetic descriptions of the process are fragmented and somewhat contradictory. To organize this subject, the past studies can be grouped according to the temperature range of study.''
% info on rates of hyrolysis

% what I actually want to focus on here, are the reactions AFTER intial hydrolysis.
% So knowledge on the rates quoted in literature are good, but I need to know what they correspond to:
	% All reactions, with just an increase in rate as the system gets hotter / more reactions splinter off? (ie more reactions happening, so more exothermic heat release - self heating
	% Does the sudden change to autocatalytic arise from a global change in the mechanism? / All the of the “first order” reaction stuff is done / it’s much less important, and that the 

It is widely agreed that first-stage decomposition follows a first-order process (or pseudo-first order, with respect to hydrolysis reactions). %REF for first & psuedo first order rate for NC
A number of studies observe catalytic rate of decay for the longer-term aging processes. %REF the studies in DAUERMAN's who quoted an autocatalytic rate. 
Dauerman \cite{Dauerman1968} observed that when \ac{NC} was treated with \ce{NO2} gas before heating, the time required for sample ignition halved. He suggested that the \ce{NO2} adsorbed onto the surface acted as a catalysing agent. 

% Now, how do the above rate observations relate to the post-denitration phases of reaction?

Neutral and alkaline hydrolysis reactions follow a pseudo-first order process, however it has been suggested that the presence of acid facilitates a catalytic rate of degradation after an initial incubation period. %Incubation is not correct - what I want to say is that the reaction starts off first order, but at an obeservable inflection point, becomes catalyitc. 
%Check whether i am jsut repeating myself from chap 2?
%The degradation of cellulose also follows a pseudo-first order rate\cite{Calvini2008}.
%
% Introducing the decondary reaction products %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Discuss the work of Camera, Aellig and Chin 2007
Multiple studies have addressed the decomposition reactions of nitrate esters following the initial scission of the nitrate group \cite{Baker1952,Camera1982,Camera1983,Matveev2003,Hu2011} %ETC refine this list later
%Kuklja made mention of some peroxy intermediates / transition states in the denitration of PETN.
In their work looking into the atmospheric reactions of methynitrate and methylperoxy nitrate Arenas suggested it was possible for the homolytic denitration reaction of methynitrate to share a common peroxy intermediate with the peroxide. This could account for some of the lower order NO\textsubscript{x} generated. %(just \ce{^{.}NO}, tbh, or maybe perhaps how NO3 may get generated?).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, secondary and extended reaction schemes for the low temperature ageing of \ac{NC} are explored. Decompostition pathways defined by Chin, Camera and Aellig \textit{et al.} are probed to determine the reactions responsible for the experimentally observed degradation products. 
The reactions found to be energetically feasible from the proposed routes will be scrutinised to determine whether an autocatalytic pathway can be formed from the thermodynamically validated reaction schemes. 

\section{Methodology}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The schemes proposed by Chin, Camera and Aellig \textit{et al.} were used to construct possible degradation routes for \ac{NC} %Proceeding on from the initial denitration step, 
with the products of homolytic fission, elimination of \ce{HNO2} and acid hydrolysis used as the starting point.
%, generating a for each proposed degradation pathway. 
Pathways were constructed based on propagation of the given reactions in a step-wise fashion; subsequent reactions were dependent on the products generated in preceding steps. %, in addition to the assumed availability of other reactants in the system. %These were at constant concentration REF
An abundance of water and oxygen were assumed present in the system, attributed to air exposure under the wetted storage conditions of \ac{NC}. %REF
Unsubsitutued alcohol moieties (R-OH) were also presumed available, due to incomplete nitration during the synthesis of \ac{NC} \cite{Wolf1997}, and re-generation following denitration \textit{via} hydrolysis. 
The schemes were modelled with \ac{EN}, then expanded to the \ac{NC} monomer. Free energies of reaction ($\Delta$ G) were used to determine the feasibility of each reaction. %Where the choice of method lead to a variation in the result of a reaction, the geometries around the reaction centres were further scrutinised in order to ensure no spurious behaviour due to artefacts from functional choice. [Bit of a dodgy sentence, how would you know what to say was right / wrong?]

%The species reactions  were geometry optimised using \ac{wb97xd}, and \ac{B3LYP} functionals, in both vacuum and solvent. The reactions were modelled using \ac{EN} as a test system before expansion to the full C2 monomeric model. 
%The \ac{DG} were used to determine . 
% Free energy paper with equations: Effect of nitrate content on thermal decomposition of nitrocellulose. Pourmortazavi,2009
%Where the choice of method lead to a variation in the result 
%Energetically feasible reactions were added to the decomposition pathway 

\subsection{Computational details}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%What you should’ve - geometry optimisations with whatever method, to a reasonably high level, then taken whichever geometry had the lowest energy. Then done the thermochemistry to an even higher level, using whatever methods you wanted, using the geometry of whatever method opt’d previously. 
All geometry optimisations were conducted in \ac{G09}, using the \acs{wb97xd} and \acs{B3LYP} functionals. Optimisations and thermochemistry calculations were performed to the level of 6-31+G(2df,p) with tight convergence criteria (table \ref{tab:convergence}).  Calculations were performed in both vacuum and with \ac{PCM} to introduce implicit solvent effects. Chemical species were constructed using \ac{GView} and for molecules of more than 3 atoms, the “Clean” function was used to re-order atoms to a preliminary starting geometry. Energies of optimised structures were checked against values listed on NIST Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database \cite{JohnsonIII2018} if analogous molecules to a similar level of theory were available.

\section{Results and Discussion}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Collation of the above schemes to fit the starting products from denitration:
%The reaction energies for the proposed schemes 

Simplified schemes for the possible ageing reactions of nitrate esters beginning from homolytic fission, elimination of \ce{HNO2} or acid hydrolysis are illustrated in schemes \ref{sch:homolytic} - \ref{sch:hydrolysis}. 
When starting with the products of homolytic fission, a branched radical chain mechanism dominates. %the propagation reactions are dominated by radical interactions. 
\ce{^{.}NO2} and \ce{HNO2} were consumed and regenerated, supporting the theory that these may be species contributing to the observed autocatalytic rate of decomposition, following a first-order rate induction period \cite{Rodger1963,Lindblom2002,Volltrauer1981}. For all schemes, \ce{R=O} and \ce{N2O} were terminating species. Whilst \ce{N2O}is released into the environment, \ce{R=O} remains in the system may go on to participate in further decomposition reactions leading to ring opening. %outside the scope of the proposed reactions. %why are they terminating species? - they do not go on to react and regenerate HNO2 and .NO2?

%Due to the availability of oxygen sites on the \ac{EN} molecule, the optimal site for protonation was determined for inclusion in the reaction scheme for the first stage of hydrolysis. 
Table \ref{tab:reactions} shows the protonation energies for the three different oxygen sites on \ac{EN}. Despite the upper terminal oxygen possessing the most thermodynamically favourable energy of protonation, inspection of the reaction geometries shows that the bridging structure most resembles that expected for the liberation of the \ce{NO2+} group at the next step. Though appearing less thermodynamically favourable when compared to protonation at the terminal upper oxygen site, the higher energy of reaction likely arises from the instability of the protonated complex. The elongation of the \ce{O-NO2} bond allows stabilisation of the proton at the bridging site, faciliting the facile departure of \ce{NO2+}. Subsequent calculations involving the energy of the protonated \ac{EN} will employ the values associated with the protonated bridging site. 

Table \ref{tab:post_energies} shows the energies for the reactions in all schemes, for both \ac{EN} and the \ac{NC} monomer.

It is noted that the \ac{B3LYP} result does not perform so well for this reaction.

\section{Summary}
A number of proposed reactions following the denitration of \ac{NC} were validated by calculating energies of reaction with the \ac{wb97xd} and \ac{B3LYP} methods.% The reaction energies were contrasted 
It as found that except in the case nitric acid decomposition, \ce{4HNO3 <=> 4NO2 + 2H2O + O2}, most reactions were feasible at atmospheric conditions.
The reactions were used to create rough schemes of the possible routes degradation routes, with increasing number of the \ac{NC} decay. It can be seen that it is the \ce{NO2} species driving oxidation in all three schemes, and plays a central role in the extended degradation scheme of \ac{NC}.

%
%A disadvantage is that \ce{N2O} is a significant greenhouse gas, and cannot be re-converted back to \ce{HNO3}, so much be considered win experimental design when observing industrial and environmental impact.
