\section{Thermodynamics of Ethyl Nitrate reactions}
For an in ital comparison of the methods you used, you could do a diagram like the one Kuklja did (kuja2014.pdf, page 89, fig 3.7).
She also makes mention of the overestimation of activation barriers for pure DFT methods. Make sure you know the background surrounding this - why does this occur, and what is done to remedy it?
