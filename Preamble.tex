%My research is about stuff.
%It begins with a study of some stuff, and then some other stuff and things.
The dominant degradation pathways of \ac{NC} were investigated, using \ac{QM} methods to probe the primary denitration routes, followed by key secondary reactions.  %by looking at the explored degradation routes in alternative nitrate esters, and tested for \ac{NC} a truncated model for the wider polymer
The polymer structure was truncated in order to facilitate \ac{DFT} studies into the mechanistic details of denitration at individuate nitrate sites. 
Comparison of monomer, dimer and trimer units of the polymer using \ac{QTAIM} topology analysis of interaction sites, analysis of the \ac{ESP} and charges showed that the most suitable model for study of the decomposition reactions was \textbeta-glucopyranose monomer, bi-capped with methoxy groups. 
%This was determined via analysis of the \ac{QTAIM} \ac{BCP} between the capping groups and the wider monomer, when changing from hydroxyl and methoxy homogeneous or mixed groups at the C1 and C4 sites on the ring. 
The model was nitrated at the C2 position, to mimic the most stable nitration site \cite{Shukla2012a}.
%first site of nitration or last site of denitration. %REF
The primary thermolytic and hydrolytic denitration routes were explored using \ac{TS} searches and \ac{PES} scans. It was found that the thermolytic behaviour of the \ac{NC} denitration step matched the energy profile of other nitrate esters \cite{Tsyshevsky2013}. 
Protonation at the bridging oxygen site of the nitrate was found to be the most likely to lead to denitration. It was not possible to isolate a \ac{TS} for the hydrolytic reaction, though a number of % water coordination / complexation? Or possible TS geometries?
coordination schemes were tested. 
Secondary processes following initial denitration were examined. Ethyl nitrate was used as a test system before extension to the monomer. Different reaction pathways for decomposition, with forward propagation of the evolved species to the reaction step, revealed that \ce{^{.}NO2} was the most likely cause for the experimentally observed autocatalytic rate of degradation.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Impact Statement}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{impact}
This study examines the degradation properties of \ac{NC}, shedding light on the mechanistic details of decomposition that are yet currently either unknown, or are unclear %with contradictory views 
in existing literature.  
\ac{NC} is used in an extensive variety of products, with utilisation in household, industrial, military and medicinal applications. 
Improved understanding of the fundamental chemistry in the degradation of \ac{NC} could benefit the following key impact areas: \\%Despite its long history, the majority of information on the subject is only based on ag

\noindent\textbf{Knowledge \& collective benefit} %(for the common good) and expertise and education
\begin{itemize}
\item Broaden understanding and depth of knowledge in the area of \ac{NC} degradation, with the view to validate or deconflict competing schemes in literature. 
%eludcidate for reserarch and commmon knowedlge clarify
%\noindent 
\item Improve conservation practices for existing and legacy \ac{NC} products of cultural value, such as cinematographic film, artworks and historical munitions with better information on environmental conditions most impacting the decomposition pathways. 
%most damaging 
%with better understanding of the preservation and handling procedures for these aged products. % \cite{Service1999}
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Environmental}
%With increasing oil prices and forecasts of a future lack of availability, renewable non-petrochemical-based alternatives to materials synthesis could become more important. 

\begin{itemize}
%\noindent 
\item Inform %more effective 
improved \ac{NC} disposal methods, avoiding existing harsh chemical and incineration treatments, with opportunity to feed back into other manufacture streams such as the production of fertiliser. %insert into/  modify industrial process to re-formulate into other products, such as fertilisers etc. with leftover \ac{NC} etc with opportunity to streamline to more environmentally friendly methods,

%\noindent 
\item Facilitate the design of next generation \ac{NC} products with lower environmental impact, in terms of durability and recycle-ability, with cleaner %production
industrial processes. 
% in a more environmentally friendly way

%\item 
%\noindent Improve and clean up industrial processes for more environmentally benign production process.
%It could mean that \ac{NC} 	\textendash which is not derived from petrochemicals \textendash\  can help fight the plastic / waste disposal problem. %It's non-toxic to humans (CHECK) and so in its degradation, could also help fight the micro-plastics ingestion problem, in the long term. (basically, polysaccharides, like PLA etc, could assist in the long term transition from petrochemical plastics to biodegradability. Though \ac{NC} isn't necessary biodegradable without specific microbes found in the lab yet - better understanding of its breakdown could facility an easier process for this.)

\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item Refine guidelines on safety and usage, based on detailed knowledge of the degradation mechanisms, improving upon current practices based on aggregate experimental observations. %cruder
%with better understanding of the actual reactions that take place, instead of a broad-brush style guidelines based on historical \/ less precise experimental observations.
%Current decomposition mechanisms are speculated based on aggregate experimental measurements giving a crude understanding of the degradation patterns in the material.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Industrial \& commercial}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve versatility and adaptability in \ac{NC} production and its product formulations, in view of varying cellulose feedstock sources due to supply chain fluctuation. 

\item Streamline industrial processes to specific reactivity requirements, based on detailed mechanistic considerations regarding shelf life and interaction with other components, leading to cost saving and better performance of final product.%  if we know what can be trimmed - commerical benefits by cutting waste, optimising work flows and tailoring processes to exact instead of wide-margin.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Innovation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow the design of new \ac{NC} products, not limited by 
%previous assumptions 
crude understanding about the material shelf life and reactivity, leading to novel applications. % etc (obviously this is a big generalisation. IT might be that the current industrial standards are ok / not too far off. But at least this might mean better/ more tailored / cheaper stabiliser / plasticiser formulations can be used, or things that are more readily available and more options, in case certain things become unavailable.) 

%\item 
%\item Facilitate the design of products for applications that were previously not known that the material was suitable for.% we didn't know it was suitable for, before
