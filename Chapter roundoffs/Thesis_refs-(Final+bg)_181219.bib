abstract = {Nitrogen is a vital component in living organisms as it participates in the making of essential biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, etc. In the biosphere, nitrogen cycles between the oxidation states +V and  III producing many species that constitute the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. All reductive branches of this cycle involve the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, which is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrate reductase. The characterization of nitrate reductases from prokaryotic organisms has allowed us to gain considerable information on the molecular basis of nitrate reduction. Prokaryotic nitrate reductases are mononuclear Mo-containing enzymes sub-grouped as respiratory nitrate reductases, periplasmic nitrate reductases and assimilatory nitrate reductases. We review here the biological and molecular properties of these three enzymes along with their gene organization and expression, which are necessary to understand the biological processes involved in nitrate reduction.},

abstract = {The production of nitrocellulose (NC) creates large quantities of waste NC fines in wash water streams. Current processing techniques attempt to remove these fines by cross-flow microfiltration, air flotation, settling, centrifugation and lime precipitation. To date, no fundamental study investigating the interfacial thermodynamics of these fines has been reported. This work explored the stability of NC fines in water employing the DLVO model and the more recently developed extended DLVO (ExDLVO) model as described by van Oss and colleagues [van Oss C. J., Chaudhury M. K. and Good R. J. (1988) Chem. Rev. 88, 927-941]. Both models predicted that NC fines will become unstable and coagulate, with the addition of a 1:1 indifferent electrolyte at ionic strengths greater than approx. 5 mM. The ExDLVO theory, which accounts for Lewis acid-base (AB) interactions, predicted greater attractive potential energy availability. Experimental studies corroborated modeling predictions. Results indicate that NC fines may be easily destabilized allowing potential reuse. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The experimental determination of the activation energies is particularly difficult when several possible reaction pathways coexist in the thermal decomposition. Ab initio calculations intended to provide an interpretation of the experiment are often of little help if they produce only the activation barriers and ignore the kinetics of the decomposition process. To overcome this ambiguity, a theoretical study of a complete picture of gas phase thermo-decomposition, including reaction energies, activation barriers, and reaction rates, is illustrated with the example of the $\beta$-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) molecule by means of quantum-chemical calculations.

It is widely used by the military in explosives, smokeless powders, mortar increments, rocket fuels, and propellants. It is virtually insoluble in water; thus surface and groundwater contamination is unlikely. In chronic, subchronic, and multigeneration studies nitrocellulose was non-toxic to rats and dogs; however, mortality was seen in mice, which was attributed to the relatively large size of the fibers relative to the size of the murine intestinal lumen rather than to chemical toxicity. Oral LD50 values are greater than 5 grams per kilogram (g/kg) in rats. The ingestion toxicity reference value (TRV) for the class Mammalia is considered non-toxic. Further, a lack of toxicity data for hindgut fermenting species, birds, reptiles, and amphibians precludes development of a TRV. Thus, nitrocellulose is likely to be non-toxic for most monogastric mammalian species.},

abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C 6 {\textperiodcentered} R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 {\textperiodcentered} R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C 6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The "double counting" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene {\textperiodcentered} H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initia calculations of the interaction energies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Grimme, J. Chem. Phys., 2006, 124, 034108). The only known shortcoming of these generally highly accurate functionals is an underestimation of the long-range dispersion (van der Waals) interactions. To correct this deficiency, we add a previously developed empirical dispersion term (DFT-D) to the energy expression but leave the electronic part of the functional untouched. Results are presented for the S22 set of non-covalent interaction energies, the G3/99 set of heat of formations and conformational energies of a phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine peptide model. We furthermore propose seven hydrocarbon reactions with strong intramolecular dispersion contributions as a benchmark set for newly developed density functionals. In general, the proposed composite approach is for many chemically relevant properties of similar quality as high-level coupled-cluster treatments. A significant increase of the accuracy for non-covalent interactions is obtained and the corrected B2PLYP DHDF provides one of the lowest ever obtained Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD) for the S22 set (0.2-0.3 kcal mol-1). Unprecedented high accuracy is also obtained for the relative energies of peptide conformations that turn out to be very difficult. The significant improvements found for the G3/99 set (reduction of the MAD from 2.4 to 1.7 kcal mol-1) underline the importance of intramolecular dispersion effects in large molecules. In all tested cases the results from the standard B3LYP approach are also significantly improved, and we recommend the general use of dispersion corrections in DFT treatments. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {Density functional theory including dispersion corrections (DFT-D) is applied to calculate intermolecular interaction energies in an extensive benchmark set consisting mainly of DNA base pairs and amino acid pairs, for which CCSD(T) complete basis set limit estimates are available (JSCH-2005 database). The three generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functionals B-LYP, PBE and the new B97-D are tested together with the popular hybrid functional B3-LYP. The DFT-D interaction energies deviate on average by less than 1 kcal mol-1 or 10{\%} from the reference values. In only six out of 161 cases, the deviation exceeds 2 kcal mol-1. With one exception, the few larger deviations occur for non-equilibrium structures extracted from experimental geometries. The largest absolute deviations are observed for pairs of oppositely charged amino acids which are, however, not significant on a relative basis due to the huge interaction energies {\textgreater}100 kcal mol-1 involved. The counterpoise (CP) correction for the basis set superposition error with the applied triple-zeta AO basis sets varies between 0 and -1 kcal mol-1 ({\textless}5{\%} of the interaction energy in most cases) except for four complexes, where it is up to -1.4 kcal mol-1. It is thus suggested to skip the laborious calculation of the CP correction in DFT-D treatments with reasonable basis sets. The three dispersion corrected GGAs considered differ mainly for the interactions of the hydrogen-bonded DNA base pairs, which are systematically too small by 0.6 kcal mol-1 in case of B97-D, while for PBE-D they are too high by 1.5 kcal mol-1, and for B-LYP-D by 0.5 kcal mol-1. The all in all excellent results that have been obtained at affordable computational costs suggest the DFT-D method to be a routine tool for many applications in organic chemistry or biochemistry. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies 2006.},

abstract = {The extent of spin contamination in unrestricted versions of pure, hybrid and double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, and its consequences, as manifested in the difference between unrestricted and restricted energies (U - R), has been investigated for 22 homolytic bond dissociation reactions. In accordance with previous studies, increasing the amount of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange in unrestricted hybrid DFT procedures leads to an increase in the extent of spin contamination. However, in unrestricted double-hybrid DFT procedures, which include both a proportion of HF exchange and a perturbative correlation contribution (MP2), the opposing behavior of UHF and UMP2 with respect to spin contamination leads to smaller differences between the energies predicted by unrestricted and restricted variants. For example, for the most spin-contaminated radicals, a 30-100 kJ mol-1 |U - R| difference at the HF and MP2 levels is reduced to just 0-5 kJ mol-1 with the double-hybrid functionals. The double-hybrid UDFT procedures can thus benefit from the inclusion of UHF and UMP2 contributions without incurring to the same extent the problems associated with spin contamination. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Five water molecules were placed in 37 different configurations around $\alpha$- and $\beta$-D-glucopyranose in the gt, gg, and tg conformational states, and the glucose-water complexes were geometry optimized using density functionals at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory. The five water molecules were organized in space and energy minimized using an empirical potential, AMB02C, and then further geometry optimized using DFT algorithms to minimum energy positions. Electronic energy, zero point vibrational energy, enthalpy, entropy, stress energy on glucose and the water cluster, hydrogen-bond energy, and relative free energy were obtained for each configuration using thermodynamic procedures and an analytical Hessian program. The lowest energy complex was that of a clustering of water molecules around the 1- and 6-hydroxyl positions of the $\beta$-gt anomer. Configurations in which the water molecules created a favorable network completely around and under glucose were found to have low energy for both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ anomers. Calculation of the $\alpha$/$\beta$ anomeric ratio using the zero point corrected energy gave,  32/68{\%}, highly favoring the $\beta$ anomer in agreement with the experimental  36/64{\%} value. This ratio is better than the  50/50{\%} ratio found in our previous monohydrate study. An approximate hydroxymethyl population was obtained by noting average relative energies among the three conformational states, gt, gg, and tg. In the $\beta$ anomer complexes the gt conformation was favored over the gg state, while in the $\alpha$ anomer complexes the gg state was favored over the gt conformation, with the tg conformations all being of higher energy making little or no contribution to the rotamer population. Some geometry variances, found between glucose in vacuo and glucose after interaction with water molecules, are described and account for some observed C-5-C-6 bond length anomalies reported by us previously for the vacuum glucose structures.},

While the reaction between isonitrosoacetophenone (inapH) with ethanolamine gives oximine alcohol (Ib), the reaction of 1-phenylethanolamine with inapH results in the formation of oximine alcohol with a different substituent (Ia) and amido alcohol (IIa), which is the unexpected rearrangement product. The rearrangement driving forces of compounds from Ia to IIa are calculated as ca. 28 and 23 kJ/mol in the gas and EtOH phases, respectively. These driving forces have been calculated ca. 46 and 45 kJ/mol for the rearrangement of compound Ib to obtain IIb in the same phases, respectively. This high driving force shows that the compound IIb cannot be obtained from rearrangement of compound Ib as described experimentally in the literature. In addition, as the DFT functionals poorly describe dispersion effects, dispersion correction for reaction heat and free-energy barrier was estimated using the wB97X-D/6-311G(d,p). In general, the relative free energies of all molecules calculated from wB97XD method are lower than performed from B3LYP level. The changes of thermodynamic properties for all molecules with temperature ranging from 100 to 500 K have been obtained using the statistical thermodynamic method.},

abstract = {The free-energy profile for the different reaction pathways available to the hydroxide ion and methyl formate in aqueous solution is reported for the first time. The theoretical analysis was carried out by using the cluster-continuum method recently proposed by us for calculating the free energy of solvation of ions. Unlike the gas-phase reaction, our results are consistent with the fact that the reaction occurs mainly by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide on the carbonyl carbon to yield a tetrahedral intermediate (BAC2 mechanism). However, an additional pathway, in which the hydroxide ion acts as a general base and a water molecule coordinated to this ion acts as the nucleophile, is also predicted to be important. The relative importance of these pathways is calculated to be 87{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively. The tetrahedral intermediate of the hydrolysis reaction has an estimated lifetime of 10 nano-seconds, and its conjugate acid has a pKa of 8.8. This tetrahedral intermediate is predicted to proceed to products by two pathways: elimination of methoxide ion (84{\%}) and by water catalyzed elimination of methanol (16{\%}). The less common reaction pathway, which involves attack of the hydroxide ion on the formyl hydrogen (decarbonylation mechanism) and leads to water, carbon monoxide, and methanol, is calculated to be only 3 kcal mol-1 less favorable than the BAC2 mechanism. By comparison, direct attack of the hydroxide ion on the methyl group (BAL2 or SN2 mechanism) leading to an acyl-oxygen bond cleavage has a very high free energy of activation and is not expected to be important. The theoretically observed activation free energy at 298.15 K is calculated to be 15.5 kcal mol-1, in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured value of 15.3 kcal mol-1. This present model allows for a clear distinction between contributions due to solvation and those due to intrinsic (gas-phase) effects and proves to yield results in very good agreement with available experimental data.},

abstract = {The potential energy surface for the prototype solvent-free ester hydrolysis reaction: OH-+HCOOCH3   products has been characterized by high level ab initio calculations of MP4/6-311 + G(2df,2p)//MP2/6-31 + G(d) quality. These calculations reveal that the approach of an OH- ion leads to the formation of two distinct ion-molecule complexes: 1) the MS1 species with the hydroxide ion hydrogen bonded to the methyl group of the ester, and 2) the MS4 moiety resulting from proton abstraction of the formyl hydrogen by the hydroxide ion and formation of a three-body complex of water, methoxide ion and carbon monoxide. The first complex reacts to generate formate anion and methanol products through the well known BAC2 and SN2 mechanisms. RRKM calculations predict that these pathways will occur with a relative contribution of 85{\%} and 15{\%} at 298.15 K, in excellent agreement with experimentally measured values of 87{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively. The second complex reacts by loss of carbon monoxide to yield the water-methoxide complex through a single minimum potential surface and is the preferred pathway in the gas-phase. This water-methoxide adduct can further dissociate if the reactants have excess energy. These results provide clear evidence that the preferred pathways for ester hydrolysis in solution are dictated by solvation of the hydroxide ion.},

abstract = {Ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to elucidate xylose and glucose degradation pathways. In the case of xylose, a 2,5-anhydride intermediate was observed leading to the formation of furfural through elimination of water. This pathway agrees with one of the mechanisms proposed in the literature in that no open chain intermediates were found. In the case of glucose, a series of intermediates were observed before forming the 2,5-anhydride intermediate that eventually leads to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). One of these intermediates was a very short-lived open-chain form. Furthermore, two novel side-reaction pathways were identified, which lead to degradation products other than HMF},

abstract = {The physicochemical properties of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and its derived reactive species determine the efficiency of the reactions that can take place in the lipid environment relative to the aqueous solution. The higher solubility of NO in membranes than in water leads to an acceleration of the rate of NO autoxidation in the membrane, while the low permeability and solubility of peroxynitrous acid in membranes is in part responsible for its low lipid oxidation yields. Protein as well as lipid oxidation and nitration represent key signaling and injury processes during nitro-oxidative conditions. This chapter emphasizes the chemistry and physical interactions of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species within lipid environments, i.e., cell membranes and lipoproteins. The key reactions of reactive nitrogen species in lipid milieu are discussed, including nitric oxide autoxidation, peroxynitrite homolysis, tyrosine nitration, and lipid-protein adduct formation in biologically relevant systems. It also discusses the mechanisms of nitrotyrosine and nitro-fatty acid formation in membranes and cells along with their key biological and redox signaling actions. The main function of lipid membranes is to separate and regulate the content of the cell interior. For many substances, lipid membranes function as an effective barrier preventing free transport in and out of the cell. Oxidation and nitration in lipid environments modify RNS-mediated cell signaling and injury processes. The final protective versus toxic effect of lipid and protein nitration processes during inflammation depends on a delicate balance in cells, the mediators of which are just starting to be identified. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Part 2 is devoted to the computation of the energy distances between multiplets, and comparison of these distances with experiment in some typical examples. There is no treatment of the separations between the various terms of a multiplet, since that has been done elsewhere, but only between one multiplet and another. It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values lie lowest, has no general significance; the present theory leads to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally, but many cases which were exceptions to that rule are in agreement with the theory. The method of calculation of multiplet distances is described in sufficient detail, with the necessary tables of coefficients, etc., so that further checks with experiment could easily be made. {\textcopyright} 1929 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this work an evaluation was made of a wide variety of single and multiple pretreatment methods for enhancing the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw. A multiple pretreatment consisted of a physical pretreatment followed by a chemical pretreatment. The structural features of wheat straw, including the specific surface area, crystallinity index, and lignin content, were measured to understand the mechanism of the enhancement in the hydrolysis rate upon pretrement. It has been found that, in general, multiple pretreatments were not promising, since the hydrolysis rates rarely exceeded those achieved by single pretreatments. Ballmilling pretreatment was found to be effective in increasing the specific surface area and decreasing the crystallinity index. Treatment with ethylene glycol was highly effective in increasing the specific surface area, in addition to a high degree of delignification. Peracetic acid pretreatment was highly effective in delignifying substrate. Among multiple pretreatments, those involving peracetic acid treatment generally had lower crystallinity indices and lignin content values. The relationship between the hydrolysis rate and the set of structural features indicated that an increase in surface area and a decrease in the crystallinity and lignin content enhance the hydrolysis; the specific surface area is the most influential of the structural features, followed by the lignin content.

In this method, the pulp sample was extracted by 17.5{\%} and 9.45{\%} NaOH solutions (25 C), respectively, to obtain two soluble fractions; i.e., the sum of $\beta$- and $\gamma$-cellulose and $\gamma$-cellulose. By reacting with potassium dichromate in a strong-acidic medium at 100 C for 60 min in a sealed headspace sample vial, these soluble celluloses in the filtrates were quantitatively converted to carbon dioxide. With the headspace equilibration at 60 C for 7 min, the formed carbon dioxide was measured by HS-GC and thus the content of $\beta$- and $\gamma$-cellulose in the pulp samples can be determined, from which the content of $\alpha$-cellulose can also be calculated. The results showed that the present method had a good measurement precision (a relative standard deviation {\textless}2.1{\%}) and accuracy (relative differences of {\textless}10{\%} compared to the reference); the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1.71{\%}. In summary, the present method is simple, practical, and is particularly suitable for use in the batch sample analysis for determining $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-cellulose content in fully delignified pulps.},

In this study, we investigated the chemical properties and toxic potential of wastewater generated during nitrocellulose production. The analyzed wastewater from settling pond contained nitrocellulose powder particles as well as increased ammonium (570 760 mg/L), sulfate (1625  2045 mg/L) and sulfite (864 1014 mg/L) concentrations. The toxicity test results demonstrated that the wastewater samples present acute toxicity for Paramecium caudatum and Daphnia magna. Furthermore, bacterial community structure in the samples was characterized by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial sequences indicated that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the main phyla in the sample near inlet, whereas various phylotypes of the phyla Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, Bacteroidetes and Gemmatimonadetes dominated in the sample near outlet. Some bacterial members observed in the current work can be considered as agents capable of performing biodegradation of various hazardous contaminants, indicating that the described bacterial communities have a high potential for the development of effective bioremediation strategies.},

abstract = {The structure of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) made by mild acid hydrolysis from cotton linter, flax fibres and sulphite or kraft cooked wood pulp was studied and compared with the structure of the starting materials. Crystallinities and the length and the width of the cellulose crystallites were determined by wide-angle X-ray scattering and the packing and the cross-sectional shape of the microfibrils were determined by small-angle X-ray scattering. The morphological differences were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A model for the changes in microfibrillar structure between native materials, pulp and MCC samples was proposed. The results indicated that from softwood or hardwood pulp, flax cellulose and cotton linter MCC with very similar nanostructures were obtained with small changes in reaction conditions. The crystallinity of MCC samples was 54-65{\%}. The width and the length of the cellulose crystallites increased when MCC was made. For example, between cotton and cotton MCC the width increased from 7.1 nm to 8.8 nm and the length increased from 17.7 nm to 30.4 nm. However, the longest crystallites were found in native spruce wood (35-36 nm). {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Available data on macroinvertebrates, fish, and algae indicate nitrocellulose is not very toxic for most aquatic species. In most evaluations the EC50 and LC50 values were 1,000 mg/L. Only for the effect on chlorophyll a content of Selenastrum capricornutum was a lower value estimated, an EC50 of 579 mg/L. Available data on human health effects and mammalian toxicity suggest nitrocellulose is virtually nontoxic. The LD50 values were in excess of 5,000 mg/kg. Chronic toxicity studies in mice demonstrated only physical effects (fiber impaction) in the digestive tract (presumably because of the small size of the mouse digestive tract). Genotoxicity and developmental toxicity studies did not demonstrate any other significant toxic effects. Carcinogenicity data generated by an epidemiology study of occupational exposure during production of nitrocellulose suggest some association between nitrocellulose and rectal/ digestive tract cancers; this should be researched further. Metabolism data in rats indicate no absorption from the GI tract. However, nitrocellulose does appear to produce significant abiotic environmental effects. Because of its fibrous nature, it blankets benthic habitats (limiting available oxygen) and fill in interstitial spaces used as cover for benthic organisms. This habitat alteration is compounded by the resistance of nitrocellulose to environmental degradation. Habitat alteration becomes a significant aspect of regulatory control},

@article{Awasthi2013,
abstract = {Standard quantum chemical methods are used for accurate calculation of thermochemical properties such as enthalpies of formation, entropies and Gibbs energies of formation. Equilibrium reactions are widely investigated and experimental measurements often lead to a range of reaction Gibbs energies and equilibrium constants. It is useful to calculate these equilibrium properties from quantum chemical methods in order to address the experimental differences. Furthermore, most standard calculation methods differ in accuracy and feasibility of the system size. Hence, a systematic comparison of equilibrium properties calculated with different numerical algorithms would provide a useful reference. We select two well-known gas phase equilibrium reactions with small molecules: covalent dimer formation of NO2 (2NO2 {\^{a}} {\OE} N2O4) and the synthesis of NH 3 (N2 + 3 H2 {\^{a}} {\OE} 2NH 3). We test four quantum chemical methods denoted by G3B3, CBS-APNO, W1 and CCSD(T) with aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets (X = 2, 3, and 4), to obtain thermochemical data for NO2, N2O4, and NH 3. The calculated standard formation Gibbs energies $\Delta$fG are used to calculate standard reaction Gibbs energies $\Delta$rG and standard equilibrium constants Keq for the two reactions. Standard formation enthalpies $\Delta$fH are calculated in a more reliable way using high-level methods such as W1 and CCSD(T). Standard entropies S for the molecules are calculated well within the range of experiments for all methods, however, the values of standard formation Gibbs energies $\Delta$fG show some dependence on the choice of the method. High-level methods perform better for the calculation of molecular energies, however, simpler methods such as G3B3 and CBS-APNO perform quite well in the calculation of total reaction energies and equilibrium constants, provided that the chemical species involved do not exhibit molecular geometries that are difficult to handle by the applied method. The temperature dependence of standard reaction Gibbs energy $\Delta$rG for the NH3 reaction is discussed by using the calculated standard formation Gibbs energies $\Delta$fG of the reaction species at 298.15 K. The corresponding equilibrium constant Keq as a function of temperature is found to be close to experimental values. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of inorganic stabilizers for double-base propellants in literature is scanty; therefore five samples (S 1-S 5) of different percentages (2-4{\%}) of nano-clinoptilolite were investigated as new inorganic stabilizers for double-base propellants (DBPs). The grain size of clinoptilolite stabilizer played an important role in the stabilization effect. As the grain size of stabilizer decreases, the surface area of stabilizer increases and the ability to absorb pronounce amount of hazardous nitrogen oxides increases. In this work clinoptilolite in nano-scale (30nm) has been used to obtain higher stabilizing effect for DBPs. The evaluation process has been performed through the classical thermal stability tests (Bergmann-Junk and calorimetric tests), in comparison with thermal analyses measurements (TGA and DSC) and kinetic parameters calculation such as activation energy (E a), enthalpy of activation ($\Delta$H *), Gibbs free energy of activation ($\Delta$G *), entropy of activation ($\Delta$S *) and frequency factor (A), which calculated using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The results for the new stabilizers were compared with that for the classical one (N,N-diethyldiphenyl urea, C 1). It has been found that the samples containing new stabilizer with percentages (3.0, 3.5 and 4.0{\%}) showed better stability effect for DBPs than the classical one. The efficiency of stabilization of each inorganic stabilizer to DBPs is also rationalized and correlated with its structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {T-Jump/FTIR and T-jump/Raman spectroscopies were used to analyze the gaseous products from six nitrate esters which were rapidly heated (2000 C/s nominal) to set temperatures in the 250 to 500 C range while maintaining a pressure of 5 atm Ar. The compounds studied were nitroglycerin (NG), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN), trimethanolethane trinitrate (TMETN), triethyleneglycol dinitrate (TEGDN), and bis(nitratomethyl) oxetane (BNMO). The atom balances were determined using all of the gaseous decomposition products based on quantitation by multivariate regression methods. With few exceptions, the oxygen balance of the nitrate ester correlated with the temperature dependence of the products, the CO2/CO ratio, the NO/CO ratio, and the amounts of H2O and total hydrocarbon liberated. The amounts of NO2 and CH2O scaled with the number of -NO2 groups and -CH2O- units in the parent molecule. The relation between the composition of the parent nitrate ester and the gaseous products from pyrolysis is the most straightforward of the various classes of oxidizing energetic functional groups studied to date. Some degree of vaporization of the parent nitrate ester was observed upon flash heating. The IR-active modes of NG and BTTN in the gaseous phase were assigned by calculation of their frequencies by density functional theory in the energy-minimized structure.},

abstract = {Waste nitrocellulose (NC) is regulated as a hazardous material. The objective of this study was to determine if NC exposed to denitrifying and sulfidogenic conditions would undergo sufficient removal of the nitro groups to yield a material that is no longer explosive. Enrichment cultures were established with methanol as the electron donor for nitrate-reducing conditions and lactate for sulfate-reducing conditions. NC was added to the cultures at 10 g/l. A statistically significant decrease in the nitrogen (N) content of NC occurred in both enrichment cultures, from approximately 13.1 13.2{\%} in virgin NC to 12.2 12.4{\%}. This was accompanied by an increase in nitrogen gas formation. The presence of a primary substrate (methanol and lactate) was necessary to affect this change; NC itself did not serve as an electron donor. In cultures that were carrying out denitrification but were then depleted of nitrate, with methanol still present, a slightly greater removal of nitro groups from NC occurred along with additional formation of nitrogen gas. NC did not have an inhibitory affect on the denitrification process but it did significantly slow the rate of lactate consumption and sulfate reduction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that NC exposed to denitrifying conditions was enriched in hydroxyl groups, consistent with removal of some of the nitro groups by hydrolysis of the nitrate esters. NC exposed to nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions and virgin NC were also compared based on their explosive properties using a small-scale burning test. The biologically treated NC exhibited somewhat less reactivity, but was still rated as explosive. The decrease in{\%}N, increase in N2, and FTIR results demonstrated that NC does undergo biotransformation in the presence of nitrate- and sulfate-reducing enrichment cultures, but the extent of denitration does not appear to be adequate to yield a nonhazardous product.},

In addition, oxygen consumption (OC) calorimetry method was compared with thermal chemistry (TC) method based on stoichiometry for HRRI calculation.

abstract = {This chapter is concerned with plastics based on cellulose, produced from either cotton linters or wood pulp. They have the advantage of being produced from a renewable source. Cellulose itself is both crystalline and hydrogen bonded, so is insoluble and cannot be melted. In order to process cellulose, it must be reacted to produce cellulose esters or ethers. Alternatively, it can be modified to become soluble, then converted back to cellulose, when it is known as regenerated cellulose, and used for films or fibers. Esters (e.g.,cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose propionate) are also unprocessable, and hence are modified with plasticizers. Their properties depend on extent of esterification, molar mass, and, particularly, plasticizer level. Applications are in those areas where appearance and toughness are important, such as ophthalmics, toys and sports goods, and spectacle frames. Ethyl cellulose is the only ether used as a plastic material.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature B.V. The thermal behavior of nitrocellulose (NC) with different nitrogen contents has been widely investigated in previous works. However, most of the experiments were carried out under high heating rates, a situation in which it is difficult to capture minor changes during the thermal decomposition process. In the present study, the thermal characteristics of NC with different nitrogen contents were theoretically and experimentally investigated using a CALVET heat flux calorimeter C80 at heating rates from 0.2 to 0.8  C/min. Before thermal analysis, the results of high-precision scanning electron microscopy showed that more cracks and coarser surfaces were detected on NC fibers with higher nitrogen contents. It was found that a  turning point  was detected on the heat flow curves of NC with higher nitrogen contents. Furthermore, the heat flow curves of NC transformed from  bell shape  to  right triangles  with increases in the nitrogen content, which suggested that NC with high nitrogen contents exhibited autocatalysis characteristics under low heating rates. This characteristic was also confirmed by the isothermal experiment results that showed the autocatalytic properties became increasingly obvious by increasing the isothermal temperature. Moreover, the relevant chemical kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were obtained. The heat of the reaction ($\Delta$H) increased and the activation energy values in the initial stages of NC decomposition decreased as the nitrogen content was increased.

In addition, the majority of grades have been certified by T{\"{U}}V Austria to the OK Compost Home standard for home composting and certain grades have been proven to biodegrade in a waste-water environment. Further testing has proven that most NatureFlex  grades are also suitable for anaerobic digestion. To further support the positioning of NatureFlex , a peer reviewed LCA has been carried out by Thinkstep, based on their GaBi software, allowing transparent communication of the environmental impacts of using these films. NatureFlex  films use novel heat seal-resins on each side. They are static free and offer a super wide heat seal range for outstanding machine performance. The films offer good gas barrier properties and the coatings can be tailored to provide varying degrees of moisture barrier, depending on the needs of the wrapped product.},

abstract = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is used throughout the stockpile as an energetic material. The formulation of PETN into XTX8003 (80{\%} PETN, 20{\%} Sylgard 182) creates an extrudable energetic composite. PETN and XTX8003 are used in the firesets for the retired W68 (MC2370) and the W76 (MC3028). When faced with potential lifetime extensions, energetic materials are naturally suspect regarding their output after prolonged aging. The authors have studied PETN and XTX8003 by looking at 25-year-old samples from retired MC2370s and newer materials. Both the old and new materials have also been placed in various accelerated aging protocols to investigate any decomposition that might occur over time. PETN is known to decompose autocatalytically even in the early stages of decomposition, but the process is poorly understood. Published values for the activation energy of decomposition vary by {\textgreater}40 kcal/mol. The 12 million year half life predicted for room temperature PETN would be dramatically shortened by chemical influences that lead to lower energy decomposition pathways. Degree of confinement, purity, and crystal size all influence degradation rates. In this paper, the authors observe the effects of chemical and thermal aging on PETN. They anticipate changes in mechanism at higher temperature aging, and before trying to extrapolate to lower temperatures, they want to make sure that they understand the different chemical processed involved.},

The energetics of five dehydration and two isomerization pathways were examined for the protonated form of BP in acidic aqueous solutions and the most favorable pathway of these was found to be the dehydration at the anomeric site. No dehydration pathway of OC glucose is favored over its isomerization to BP or to fructose. The relative ease of dehydration over isomerization depends on the selection of the reaction media for the protonated form of BP. These two reaction pathways catalyzed by a surface Br{\"{o}}nsted acid site were then examined and the isomerization pathway was found to be more favorable than dehydration at the anomeric site on a surface acid site.

@phdthesis{Linder2012,
abstract = {The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most powerful synthetic tools in organic chemistry, and asymmetric Diels-Alder catalysis allows for rapid construction of chiral carbon sca olds. For this reason, considerable e ort has been invested in developing e cient and stereoselective organo- and biocatalysts. However, Diels-Alder is a virtually unknown reaction in Nature, and to engineer an enzyme into a Diels-Alderase is therefore a challenging task. Despite several successful designs of catalytic antibodies since the 1980's, their catalytic activities have remained low, and no true arti cial 'Diels-Alderase' enzyme was reported before 2010.

In this thesis, we employ state-of-the-art computational tools to study the mechanism of organocatalyzed Diels-Alder in detail, and to redesign existing enzymes into intermolecular Diels-Alder catalysts. Papers I IV explore the mechanistic variations when employing increasingly activated reactants and the e ect of catalysis. In particular, the relation between the traditionally presumed concerted mechanism and a stepwise pathway, forming one bond at a time, is probed. Papers V X deal with enzyme design and the computational aspects of predicting catalytic activity. Four novel, computationally designed Diels-Alderase candidates are presented in Papers VI IX. In Paper X, a new parameterization of the Linear Interaction Energy model for predicting protein-ligand a nities is presented.

A general  nding in this thesis is that it is di cult to attain large transition state stabilization e ects solely by hydrogen bond catalysis. In addition, water (the preferred solvent of enzymes) is well-known for catalyzing Diels- Alder by itself. Therefore, an e cient Diels-Alderase must rely on large binding a nities for the two substrates and preferential binding conformations close to the transition state geometry. In Papers VI VIII, we co-designed the enzyme active site and substrates in order to achieve the best possible complementarity and maximize binding a nity and pre-organization. Even so, catalysis is limited by the maximum possible stabilization o ered by hydrogen bonds, and by the inherently large energy barrier associated with the [4+2] cycloaddition.

The stepwise Diels-Alder pathway, proceeding via a zwitterionic intermediate, may o er a productive alternative for enzyme catalysis, since an enzyme active site may be more di erentiated towards stabilizing the high-energy states than for the standard mechanism. In Papers I and III, it is demonstrated that a hydrogen bond donor catalyst provides more stabilization of transition states having pronounced charge-transfer character, which shifts the preference towards a stepwise mechanism.

Another alternative, explored in Paper IX, is to use an $\alpha$,$\beta$ -unsaturated ketone as a 'pro-diene', and let the enzyme generate the diene in situ by general acid/base catalysis. The results show that the potential reduction in the reaction barrier with such a mechanism is much larger than for conventional Diels-Alder. Moreover, an acid/base-mediated pathway is a better mimic of how natural enzymes function, since remarkably few catalyze their reactions solely by non-covalent interactions.},

abstract = {Nitroglycerine has been used clinically in the treatment of angina for 130 years, yet important details on the mechanism of action, biotransformation, and the associated phenomenon of nitrate tolerance remain unanswered. The biological activity of organic nitrates can be said to be nitric oxide mimetic, leading to recent, exciting progress in realizing the therapeutic potential of nitrates. Unequivocally, nitroglycerine and most other organic nitrates, including NO-NSAIDs, do not behave as NO donors in the most fundamental action: in vitro activation of sGC to produce cGMP. The question as to whether the biological activity of nitrates results primarily or exclusively from NO donation will not be satisfactorily answered until the location, the apparatus, and the mechanism of reduction of nitrates to NO are defined. Similarly, the therapeutic potential of nitrates will not be unlocked until this knowledge is attained. Aspects of the therapeutic and biological activity of nitrates are reviewed in the context of the chemistry of nitrates and the elusive efficient 3e  reduction required to generate NO.},

@article{Foltz2009,
abstract = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a relatively sensitive explosive used in many electroexplosive devices as well as in medicine. Of primary interest to LLNL is its use in items such as exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators and exploding bridge foil initiators (EFI). In these devices the crystalline powder is pressed into a granular, low-density compact that can be initiated by an exploding wire or foil. The long-term stability of this pressed compact is of interest to weapon stockpile lifetime prediction studies. Key points about potential aging mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1) There are a number of factors that can contribute to PETN instability. These include particle size, polymorphic phase transitions, crystal structure, impurities, moisture, occlusions, chemical incompatibility and biological (microorganism) action. of these factors the most important for long-term aging of high surface area powders used in detonators appears to be that of particle size growth. (2) There is a great deal of literature on the thermal degradation kinetics of PETN, unfortunately much of it with little bearing on ambient temperature aging during long-term storage. PETN is very stable with respect to thermal decomposition. Low-temperature thermal studies have not revealed evidence of chemical degradation products in archived PETN. Data extrapolated to 30 C predicts a half-life of 12 million years. (3) Moisture seems to lower the activation energy for and accelerate the decomposition of PETN. (4) External drivers affecting stability include temperature, moisture, radiation fields, and stress, while internal drivers include residual solvents, and impurities. Temperature affects kinetic processes of crystal growth such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion rates of molecules on the surface of PETN crystals. A low-level radiation field may induce unexpected changes in the chemical makeup of PETN and its homologue impurities. Stress at high pressure points caused by crystalline surface irregularities may cause a decrease in surface area over time due to smoothing of contact points and sintering. PETN has been found to contain a number of impurities, including homologues, pentaerythryl ethers with a mixture of hydroxyl and nitrate functional groups, and organic salts, that can alter its physical and chemical properties. (5) The processes of sublimation/recrystallization and surface diffusion are important processes that can cause changes in PETN crystal morphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area. Sublimation feeds a process called Ostwald ripening, which involves the spontaneous growth of larger crystals from those of smaller size. This process proceeds with age regardless of storage conditions unless the crystals are treated to retard growth. The coarsening mechanisms include Ostwald ripening, 'sintering', and surface diffusion. The latter has not been experimentally observed, but a molecular modeling approach has attempted to investigate this phenomenon theoretically. (6) Threshold test fire, particle size distribution, specific surface area, thermal analysis, chemical analysis, powder compact specific surface area and density are approaches that have been used in the attempt to assess changes attributable to aging of PETN, with varying results. The biggest problem lies in the aging mechanism itself, which likely influences small changes in morphology, both internal and external, and particle size distribution changes on a scale too small to reliably monitor. Other aspects, such as subtle changes in density profiles within pressed powder compacts, may be beyond the capability of current technology to assess. Crystal growth significant enough to affect the PETN particle size distribution is expected to impact detonator performance. (7) Factors relevant to stabilizing particle size growth include crystal morphology, powder surface area and particle size distribution; crystal density and internal defects; and powder compact density and density gradients.},

abstract = {Well-characterized, purified samples of glycidyl azide polymer (MW 700) having one, two, or three terminal -OH groups were flash pyrolyzed (dT/dt = 800 K/s) to 540 600 K under 2 atm Ar by T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy. This technique emphasizes condensed-phase pyrolysis chemistry as opposed to gas-phase flame chemistry. The volatile products identified from the condensed phase were CH4, HCN, CO, C2H4, NH3, CH2O, CH2CO, H2O, and GAP oligomers. IR-inactive N2 is, of course, also present. The low MW products result from homolysis of the heavy atom bonds and H-atom migration, as opposed to heavy atom recombination reactions. After N2 release, the relations between the mole fractions of the products and the parent GAP structure were determined. The NH3 content increases with the -OH content, which suggests that NH3 is mostly formed by the end-chain azide groups. The hydrocarbon mole fractions correlate with the structure of the parent sample of GAP. CO appears to form from both the parent polymer and secondary sources, such as CH2O and CH2CO, at higher temperature. The HCN/NH3 ratio increases with increasing temperature. By using the product mole fractions and heat of formation of GAP, the calculated heat of decomposition ( 1.4 kcal/g) is found to be three times larger than that measured by DSC ( 0.43 kcal/g). The large $\Delta$Hd helps explain the reported high surface temperature. The relatively low reported flame temperature during combustion reflects the limited number of secondary exothermic reactions that are possible among the products. If it occurs during combustion, the apparent release of some GAP oligomers observed during flash pyrolysis would raise the flame temperature by allowing the decomposition of some of the GAP in the gas phase. The kinetics of formation of NH3 [Ea = 49 kcal/mol, In(A/s) = 42] were determined below the autothermal stage. Above the autothermal stage, the products form at too rapid a rate to be measured by the methods used.},

abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

abstract = {Abstract. Organic nitrate chemistry is the primary control over the lifetime of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in rural and remote continental locations. As NOx emissions decrease, organic nitrate chemistry becomes increasingly important to urban air quality. However, the lifetime of individual organic nitrates and the reactions that lead to their production and removal remain relatively poorly constrained, causing organic nitrates to be poorly represented by models. Guided by recent laboratory and field studies, we developed a detailed gas phase chemical mechanism representing most of the important individual organic nitrates. We use this mechanism within the WRF-Chem model to describe the role of organic nitrates in nitrogen oxide chemistry and in comparisons to observations. We find the daytime lifetime of total organic nitrates with respect to all loss mechanisms to be 2.6h in the model. This is consistent with analyses of observations at a rural site in central Alabama during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in summer 2013. The lifetime of the first-generation organic nitrates is {\~{}}2h versus the 3.2h lifetime of secondary nitrates produced by oxidation of the first-generation nitrates. The different generations are subject to different losses, with dry deposition to the surface dominant loss process for the second-generation organic nitrates, and chemical loss dominant for the first-generation organic nitrates. Removal by hydrolysis is found to be responsible for the loss of {\~{}}30{\%} of the total organic nitrate pool.},

The kinetic parameters with heat balance were analysed and used for the simulation of the adiabatic behavior time to the maximum rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRad). The results indicated that the thermal history significantly influenced the dynamic DSC curves, decomposition kinetics and thermal stability of NC, which decomposes autocatalytically.

abstract = {Different DFT methods give relative energies for models of the FeMo cluster in nitrogenase that differ by up to 600 kJ mol  1 . This is 4 30 times more than what is observed for other systems and explain why previous computational studies have given conflicting results. It is caused by differences in the oxidation state of the metals and the number of Fe C, Fe S and Fe H bonds, connected to the amount of static correlation. Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can cleave the triple bond in N 2 , making nitrogen avaiable for other organisms. It contains a complicated MoFe 7 S 9 C(homocitrate) cluster in its active site. Many computational studies with density-functional theory (DFT) of the nitrogenase enzyme have been presented, but they do not show any consensus   they do not even agree where the first four protons should be added, forming the central intermediate E 4 . We show that the prime reason for this is that different DFT methods give relative energies that differ by almost 600 kJ mol  1 for different protonation states. This is 4 30 times more than what is observed for other systems. The reason for this is that in some structures, the hydrogens bind to sulfide or carbide ions as protons, whereas in other structures they bind to the metals as hydride ions, changing the oxidation state of the metals, as well as the Fe C, Fe S and Fe Fe distances. The energies correlate with the amount of Hartree Fock exchange in the method, indicating a variation in the amount of static correlation in the structures. It is currently unclear which DFT method gives the best results for nitrogenase. We show that non-hybrid DFT functionals and TPSSh give the most accurate structures of the resting active site, whereas B3LYP and PBE0 give the best H 2 dissociation energies. However, no DFT method indicates that a structure of E 4 with two bridging hydride ions is lowest in energy, as spectroscopic experiments indicate.},

The results from these tests, coupled with an economic analysis, indicated that salvation of NC with the best solvent tested, acetone, and mixing with No. 2 fuel oil was not technically feasible or cost effective due to the low solubility of the NC.

abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from the high-NO x photooxidation of isoprene was dissolved in water and irradiated with l {\textgreater} 290 nm radiation to simulate direct photolytic processing of organics in atmospheric water droplets. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize the composition at four time intervals (0, 1, 2, and 4 h). Photolysis resulted in the decomposition of high molecular weight (MW) oligomers, reducing the average length of organics by 2 carbon units. The average molecular composition changed significantly after irradiation (C 12 H 19 O 9 N 0.08 + hn -C 10 H 16 O 8 N 0.40). Approximately 65{\%} by count of SOA molecules decomposed during photolysis, accompanied by the formation of new products. An average of 30{\%} of the organic mass was modified after 4 h of direct photolysis. In contrast, only a small fraction of the mass (o2{\%}), belonging primarily to organic nitrates, decomposed in the absence of irradiation by hydrolysis. Furthermore, the concentration of aromatic compounds increased significantly during photolysis. Approximately 10{\%} (lower limit) of photodegraded compounds and 50{\%} (upper limit) of the photoproducts contain nitrogen. Organic nitrates and multifunctional oligomers were identified as compounds degraded by photolysis. Low-MW 0N (compounds with 0 nitrogen atoms in their structure) and 2N compounds were the dominant photoproducts. Fragmentation experiments using tandem mass spectrometry (MS n , n = 2 3) indicate that the 2N products are likely heterocyclic/aromatic and are tentatively identified as furoxans. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, these 2N heterocyclic compounds are produced by reactions between photochemically-formed aqueous NO x species and SOA organics.},

@article{Hanwell2012,
abstract = {Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

Since the computation time for analytical energy gradients is approximately the same as for the energy, the optimization algorithm evaluates and utilizes the gradients each time the energy is computed. The second derivative matrix, rather than its inverse, is updated employing the gradients. At each step, a one dimensional minimization using a quartic polynomial is carried out, followed by an n dimensional search using the second derivative matrix. By suitably controlling the number of negative eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix, the algorithm can also be used to locate transition structures.

abstract = {The energetics of the gas-phase SN2 reactions Y- + CH3X-   CH3Y + X- (where X,Y = F,Cl,Br), were studied using (variants on) the recent W1 and W2 ab initio computational thermochemistry methods. These calculations involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of up to spdfgh quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and contributions of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic effects, and (where relevant) first-order spin-orbit coupling. Our computational predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental data where these have small error bars; in a number of other instances reexamination of the experimental data may be in order. Our computed benchmark data (including cases for which experimental data are unavailable altogether) are used to assess the quality of a number of compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2 theory, G3 theory, and CBS-QB3, as well as a variety of density functional theory methods. Upon applying some modifications to the level of theory used for the reference geometry (adding diffuse functions, replacing B3LYP by the very recently proposed mPWIK functional [Lynch, B. J.; Fast, P. L.; Harris, M.; Truhlar, D. G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 4811]), the compound methods appear to perform well. Only the "half-and-half" functionals BH{\&}HLYP and mPWH{\&}HPW91, and the empirical mPWIK functional, consistently find all required stationary points; the other functionals fail to find a transition state in the F/Br case. BH{\&}HLYP and mPWH{\&}HpW91 somewhat overcorrect for the tendency of B3LYP (and, to a somewhat lesser extent, mPW1PW91) to underestimate barrier heights. The Becke97 and Becke97-1 functionals perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study, while the HCTH and HCTH-120 functionals both appear to underestimate central barriers. HCTH underestimates complexation energies; this problem is resolved in HCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the functionals considered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound thermochemistry methods. mPW1K, however, appears to be very suitable for generating reference geometries for more elaborate thermochemical methods in kinetics applications. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We have computed consistent benchmark potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the anti-E2, syn-E2, and SN2 pathways of X- + CH 3CH2X with X = F and Cl. This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid densityfunctional theory (DFT). The ab Initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) {\textless} SN2 (X = F) {\textless} SN2 (X = Cl)   syn-E2 (X = F) {\textless} anti-E2 (X = Cl) {\textless} syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F- + CH 3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl- + CH3CH2CI, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway. Best overall agreement with our ab Initio benchmark is obtained by representatives from each of the three categories of functionals, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid DFT, with mean absolute errors in, for example, central barriers of 4.3 (OPBE), 2.2 (M06-L), and 2.0 kcal/mol (M06), respectively. Importantly, the hybrid functional BHandH and the meta-GGA M06-L yield incorrect trends and qualitative features of the PESs (in particular, an erroneous preference for SN2 over the anti-E2 in the case of F- + CH 3CH2F) even though they are among the best functionals as measured by their small mean absolute errors of 3.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol in reaction barriers. OLYP and B3LYP have somewhat higher mean absolute errors in central barriers (5.6 and 4.8 kcal/mol, respectively), but the error distribution is somewhat more uniform, and as a consequence, the correct trends are reproduced. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

OBJECTIVE: Develop a composite propellant which has an extended plateau region in its burning rate vs. pressure relationship curve, as well as minimized variation in ballistic performance as a function of temperature change. DESCRIPTION: Double base (nitrocellulose {\&} nitroglycerine based) propellants widely used in Navy aircraft ejection seat systems experience degradation and depletion of the stabilizers used in the formulation over time with exposure to high operational and storage temperatures. This degradation results in safety risks due to the possibility of inadvertent spontaneous deflagration of the propellant. Current composite propellants typically do not have a pronounced plateau in their burning rate vs. pressure curves, and have a wider variation in performance with changes in temperature as compared to double base propellants. An innovative composite propellant to replace the current double based propellants used must be nitrate ester free and thermally stable across an operating temperature range from -65 degrees F to +200 degrees F. Ideally the propellant burning rate in the plateau region at ambient temperature would be approximately 1.0 inches per second at 2000 pounds per square inch (psi), followed by a negative slope in the burning rate curve, extending through at least 4500 to 5000 psi, and dropping by at least 0.4 inches per second. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Sigma sub p) would ideally be sp = 0.1 {\%}/ K or less. Such a composite propellant would have performance characteristics similar to a plateau burning double base propellant, currently in use in Naval ejection seat systems, but without the limited life inherent in propellants containing nitrate esters. This formulation would be developed and validated through adjustments to the propellant composition, followed by burning rate testing to demonstrate the effects of adjustments made. The burning rates of the final formulation supplied to the Navy will be measured at -65F, ambient temperature, and +200F across the pressure range of 500 to 5000 PSI. The formulation must contain ingredients which have been tested to demonstrate compatibility with each other. Mechanical properties testing, as well as basic propellant safety and characterization tests in accordance with NAVSEAINST 8020.5C are to be conducted, so a Department of Defense Interim Hazard Classification can be obtained for the propellant. The tests would be conducted on zero-time and propellant samples aged for 64 days at 200F, and the results supplied to the Navy. PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of the composite propellant developed in accordance with the identified parameters. PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate through testing, a formulation which meets the performance objectives for burning rate and temperature sensitivity across the pressure range on zero-time and aged propellant samples. Characterization tests, scale up of the propellant manufacturing process, and manufacture of a quantity of propellant samples, one to two kilograms, for delivery to the Navy would also be performed in Phase II. PHASE III: Conduct the complete propellant characterization testing per NAVSEAINST 8020.5C and manufacture and transition a quantity of propellant samples for delivery to the Navy for testing. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: A composite propellant developed under this effort could be used in commercial mining, blasting, oil and gas exploration cartridge applications where consistent performance is required across a wide variation in temperature.

abstract = {All-cellulose nanocomposite (ACNC) film was produced from sugarcane bagasse nanofibers using N,N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride solvent. The average diameter of bagasse fibers (14 $\mu$m) was downsized to 39 nm after disk grinding process. X-ray diffraction showed that apparent crystallinity and crystallite size decreased relatively to an increased duration of dissolution time. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that thermal stability of the ACNC was slightly less than that of the pure cellulose nanofiber sheet. Tensile strength of the fiber sheet, nanofiber sheet and ACNC prepared with 10 min dissolution time were 8, 101 and 140 MPa, respectively. Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the ACNC film increased relatively to an increased duration of dissolution time. ACNC can be considered as a multi-performance material with potential for application in cellulose-based food packaging owing to its promising properties (tough, bio-based, biodegradable and acceptable levels of WVP). {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim This work aims to improve the computation of infrared spectra of gas-phase cations using DFT methods. Experimental infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra for ten Zn and Ru organometallic complexes have been used to provide reference data for 64 vibrational modes in the 900 2000 cm  1 range. The accuracy of the IR vibrational frequencies predicted for these bands has been assessed over five DFT functionals and three basis sets. The functionals include the popular B3LYP and M06-2X hybrids and the range-separated hybrids (RSH) CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP, and $\omega$B97X-D. B3LYP gives the best mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 7.1 and 9.6 cm  1 , whilst the best RSH functional, $\omega$B97X-D, gives 12.8 and 16.6 cm  1 , respectively. Using linear correlations instead of scaling factors improves the prediction accuracy significantly for all functionals. Experimental and computed spectra for a single complex can show significant differences even when the molecular structure is calculated correctly, and a means of defining confidence limits for any given computed structure is also provided.},

abstract = {Molecular level understanding of acid-catalysed conversion of sugar molecules to platform chemicals such as hydroxy-methyl furfural (HMF), furfuryl alcohol (FAL), and levulinic acid (LA) is essential for efficient biomass conversion. In this paper, the high-level G4MP2 method along with the SMD solvation model is employed to understand detailed reaction energetics of the acid-catalysed decomposition of glucose and fructose to HMF. Based on protonation free energies of various hydroxyl groups of the sugar molecule, the relative reactivity of gluco-pyranose, fructo-pyranose and fructo-furanose are predicted. Calculations suggest that, in addition to the protonated intermediates, a solvent assisted dehydration of one of the fructo-furanosyl intermediates is a competing mechanism, indicating the possibility of multiple reaction pathways for fructose to HMF conversion in aqueous acidic medium. Two reaction pathways were explored to understand the thermodynamics of glucose to HMF; the first one is initiated by the protonation of a C2-OH group and the second one through an enolate intermediate involving acyclic intermediates. Additionally, a pathway is proposed for the formation of furfuryl alcohol from glucose initiated by the protonation of a C2-OH position, which includes a C-C bond cleavage, and the formation of formic acid. The detailed free energy landscapes predicted in this study can be used as benchmarks for further exploring the sugar decomposition reactions, prediction of possible intermediates, and finally designing improved catalysts for biomass conversion chemistry in the future. ? 2012 the Owner Societies.},

@phdthesis{Tucker2013,
abstract = {The manufacturing process for solventless extruded double base propellants involves a number of rolling and reworking stages. Throughout these processes a decrease in weight average molecular weight was observed, this was attributed to denitration. Differential scanning calorimetery data indicated that the reworking stages of extruded double base propellant manufacture were crucial to the homogenisation of the propellant mixture. To determine the homogeneity of the final extruded product, a sample was analysed across its diameter. No variations in stabiliser concentration, molecular weight, or Vickers hardness were detected. An accelerated thermal ageing trial simulating up to 8 years of ageing at 25 C was carried out to evaluate the storage characteristics. Reductions in stabiliser concentration, number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight and polydispersity compared with un-aged samples were observed. The glass transition temperature measured using differential scanning calorimetery decreased by {\~{}}3 C. The decrease was attributed to the initial denitration reducing the energy of bond rotation and shortening the polymer chains, both factors reducing the energy required for movement. Modulus values determined from dynamic mechanical analysis temperature scanning experiments, did not detect significant variation between un-aged and aged samples. Though it was considered that variations would be likely if a more extensive ageing program was completed. In order to evaluate propellant behaviour at very high and low frequencies, time temperature superposition (TTS) and creep testing were carried out. The TTS technique superpositioned data well, allowing future investigation of high frequency propellant properties. Creep testing was considered to be an appropriate approach, though the equipment available was not optimised for such testing. This thesis is concerned with understanding how propellants are manufactured from nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine and other constituents. It is also about how the propellants decompose during long periods of time in storage, and how these changes can be measured using thermal and mechanical methods. It is about how the physical, chemical and thermal properties of the propellant composition change throughout the manufacture. This is relevant as it could be used to develop more efficient manufacturing processes, allow operators to adjust processes to tailor product properties or be used to re-design manufacturing to compensate for a different starting material. The thesis also considers how and why the properties of the product change over the course of years of storage. A specific focus on whether changes in mechanical and thermal properties occur, and if so how they can be detected.},

abstract = {Although the thermal behaviors including thermal instability of nitrocellulose (NC) and its mixtures with some humectants have been comprehensively examined previously in the literature, their combustion characteristics have not been systematically studied. To address the issue, the combustion properties of NC with alcohol humectants are investigated by the means of the ISO 5660 cone calorimeter. Two kinds of NC-humectant mixtures with 30wt.{\%} isopropanol and 30wt.{\%} ethanol, respectively, were employed as samples. The tests were conducted under different external radiations, ranging from 0 15kW/m2. The experimental results indicate that the external radiation positively influences the peak heat release rate (HRR) intensity and the maximum mass loss rate (MLR), while the total heat release (THR) decreases with the elevated external radiation. Comparatively, the sample with isopropanol exhibits a higher fire risk, characterized by the higher peak HRR, THR and maximum MLR. Auxiliary investigating methods, including Scanning Electron Microscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimeter-Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, were applied to examine the micro structure and thermal behavior of NC-humectant mixtures. The results helped to explain the burning characteristics observed in the cone calorimeter tests.},

Extruded materials also showed some evidence of the first-order transition as well as the commonly observed $\alpha$-relaxation. The state of the aged rolled material was changed by annealing in such a way that the first-order transition disappeared and was replaced by the frequency-dependent $\alpha$-transition.

abstract = {Nitrocellulose membranes, one of the most important and oldest cellulose derivatives, are commonly used for nucleic acid and protein detection in research and diagnostic applications. However, a limited number of studies have explored whether they can act as scaffolds for cell growth. In this study, we investigated this polymeric material for its ability to support the growth of human cells. Eight established cell lines were examined for adherence, growth, spread, and survival on nitrocellulose membranes by optical microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin and/or immunocytochemical staining and by scanning electron microscopy. Apoptosis and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also assessed. All cells readily adhered to and spread on the surface of nitrocellulose membranes as well as coverslips, and the cells maintained the expression of digestive system-specific genes. No significant change was detected in apoptosis or leakage of LDH from cells grown on nitrocellulose membranes. These results suggested that nitrocellulose membranes have a suitable cytocompatibility towards human cells and that they might be used for tissue-engineering scaffolds.

abstract = {Proton transfer reactions play a key role in the conversion of biomass derived sugars to chemicals. In this study, we employ high level ab initio theoretical methods, in tandem with solvation effects to calculate the proton affinities (PA) and acidity constants (pKa) of various d-glucose and d-fructose tautomers (protonation-deprotonation processes). In addition, we compare the theoretically derived pH values of sugar solutions against experimentally measured pH values in our lab. Our results demonstrate that the protonation of any of the O atoms of the sugars is thermodynamically preferred without any significant variation in the PA values. Intramolecular hydrogen transfers, dehydration reactions, and ring-opening processes were observed, resulting from the protonation of specific hydroxyl groups on the sugars. Regarding the deprotonation processes (pKa), we found that the sugars' anomeric hydroxyls exhibit the highest acidity. The theoretically calculated pH values of sugar solutions are in excellent agreement with experimental pH measurements at low sugar concentrations. At higher sugar concentrations the calculations predict less acidic solutions than the experiments. In this case, we expect the sugars to act as solvents increasing the proton solvation energy and the acidity of the solutions. We demonstrated through linear relationships that the pKa values are correlated with the relative stability of the conjugate bases. The latter is related to hydrogen bonding and polarization of the C-O(-) bond. A plausible explanation for the good performance of the direct method in calculating the pKa values of sugars can be the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the conjugate base. Both theory and experiments manifest that fructose is a stronger acid than glucose, which is of significant importance in self-catalyzed biomass-relevant dehydration reactions.},

Prior structural calculations identify O6 as the preferred protonation site for O-methyl $\alpha$-d-galactopyranoside, but the $\beta$-anomeric configuration favors the inversion of the pyranose ring from the 4C1 chair configuration, to 1C4, and the formation of proton bridges to the (axial) O1 and O3 sites. In the hydrated complex, however, the proton bonds to the water molecule inserted between the O6 and Ow sites, and the ring retains its original 4C1 conformation, supported by a circular network of co-operatively linked hydrogen bonds. Two distinct proton transfer processes, operating over a time scale of 10 ps, have been identified in $\beta$Gal-H + at 500 K. One of them leads to chemical reaction and the formation of an oxacarbenium ion (accompanied by the loss of an H2O molecule). In the hydrated complex, $\beta$Gal-H+-H2O, this reaction is suppressed, and the proton transfer, which involves multiple jumps between the sugar and the H2O, creates an H3O+ ion, relevant, perhaps, to the reactivity of protonated sugars both in the gas and condensed phases. Anticipating future spectroscopic investigations, the vibrational spectra of $\beta$Gal-H+ and $\beta$Gal-H +-H2O have also been computed through AIMD simulations conducted at average temperatures of 300 and 40 K and also through vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) calculations at 0 K. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

Approximately 20-30 water molecules were included along with the acid in the QM portion of the calculation, which was carried out at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level. Whereas dissociation to ions is always spontaneous in the bulk, we find that acid molecules confined to the water surface dissociate only with the participation of two additional water molecules, forming a "critical cluster" about the solute. Thus acid dissociation may occur in the near-surface zone at a dynamic air-water interface, in agreement with our earlier experimental conclusions [Clifford et al., Phys. Chem. Chem.

Full geometry optimization was performed on different ring geometries and on the hydroxymethyl rotamers (gg/gt/tg). Analytically derived Hessians were used to calculate zero point energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The lowest energy and free energy conformation found is the $\alpha$-tg(g-)-4C1-c conformation, which is only slightly higher in electronic ( 0.2 kcal/mol) and free energy than the lowest energy $\alpha$-d-glucopyranose. The in vacuo calculations showed a small ( 0.3 kcal/mol) energetic preference for the $\alpha$- over the $\beta$-anomer for allopyranose in the 4C1 conformation, whereas in the 1C4 conformation a considerable ( 1.6 kcal/mol) energetic preference for the $\beta$- over the $\alpha$-anomer for allopyranose was encountered. The results are compared to previous aldohexose calculations in vacuo. Boat and skew forms were found that remained stable upon gradient optimization although many starting boat conformations moved to other skew forms upon optimization. As found for glucose, mannose, and galactose the orientation and interaction of the hydroxyl groups make the most significant contributions to the conformation/energy relationship in vacuo. A comparison of different basis sets and density functionals is made in the Discussion section, confirming the appropriateness of the level of theory used here.},

abstract = {Abstract. The presence of alcohol, organonitrate, and organosulfate species related to the gaseous precursor isoprene in ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has stimulated investigations of the nature of SOA-phase chemical processing. Recent work has suggested that certain isoprene-derived organonitrates are able to efficiently convert to organosulfates and alcohols on ambient SOA. In order to better understand the structure activity relationships previously observed for the isoprene-derived organonitrates and organosulfates, the hydrolysis reactions of a number of monofunctional and difunctional organonitrates and organosulfates with varying carbon substitution properties were investigated. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to study the bulk phase aqueous reactions of these organonitrates and organosulfates in order to determine hydrolysis reaction rate and, in some cases, thermodynamics information. Electronic structure calculations were also carried out to determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for these species, and for the previously studied isoprene-derived species. The results suggest that while organonitrates and organosulfates are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the corresponding alcohols at standard state, only the tertiary organonitrates (and perhaps some tertiary organosulfates) are able to efficiently hydrolyze on SOA timescales and acidities.},

abstract = {Demilitarisation is an increasingly important aspect of munitions management. With a drive for higher performance and greater safety, new munitions and fillings render old munitions obsolete and munitions stockpiles cost money both to establish and maintain so surplus munitions are an unwelcome expense and potentially a risk. The process of disposal is being shaped by a number of factors. Foremost is increasingly stringent environmental regulation restricting and modifying the methods. But other factors are also significant such as transhipment regulation, restrictions on proliferation of conventional weapons, and resource recovery either through financial pressure or policy. The result is a menagerie of demilitarisation techniques   sometimes complementary, sometimes competing   that this paper provides an overview of. All munitions have a finite service life and will at some stage need to be either expended or disposed of. Disposal can involve dumping, resale and demilitarisation. Dumping is banned at sea as a result of the London Convention and related agreements. Dumping on land is severely restricted if not banned in most jurisdictions. Resale is an attractive option in terms of recovering value from munitions however munitions must be serviceable to resell and this option is restricted by issues of proliferation and security. This leaves demilitarisation as the primary method of disposal. Demilitarisation means removing or otherwise neutralising the military potential of an item, in this case a munition. This may or may not involve the destruction of the munition but it does require that the energetic material is destroyed or converted. 1.1},

abstract = {Background: In converting biomass to bioethanol, pretreatment is a key step intended to render cellulose more amenable and accessible to cellulase enzymes and thus increase glucose yields. In this study, four cellulose samples with different degrees of polymerization and crystallinity indexes were subjected to aqueous sodium hydroxide and anhydrous liquid ammonia treatments. The effects of the treatments on cellulose crystalline structure were studied, in addition to the effects on the digestibility of the celluloses by a cellulase complex. Results: From X-ray diffractograms and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, it was revealed that treatment with liquid ammonia produced the cellulose III Iallomorph; however, crystallinity depended on treatment conditions. Treatment at a low temperature (25 C) resulted in a less crystalline product, whereas treatment at elevated temperatures (130 C or 140 C) gave a more crystalline product. Treatment of cellulose I with aqueous sodium hydroxide (16.5 percent by weight) resulted in formation of cellulose II, but also produced a much less crystalline cellulose. The relative digestibilities of the different cellulose allomorphs were tested by exposing the treated and untreated cellulose samples to a commercial enzyme mixture (Genencor-Danisco; GC 220). The digestibility results showed that the starting cellulose I samples were the least digestible (except for corn stover cellulose, which had a high amorphous content). Treatment with sodium hydroxide produced the most digestible cellulose, followed by treatment with liquid ammonia at a low temperature. Factor analysis indicated that initial rates of digestion (up to 24 hours) were most strongly correlated with amorphous content. Correlation of allomorph type with digestibility was weak, but was strongest with cellulose conversion at later times. The cellulose IIIIsamples produced at higher temperatures had comparable crystallinities to the initial cellulose I samples, but achieved higher levels of cellulose conversion, at longer digestion times. Conclusions: Earlier studies have focused on determining which cellulose allomorph is the most digestible. In this study we have found that the chemical treatments to produce different allomorphs also changed the crystallinity of the cellulose, and this had a significant effect on the digestibility of the substrate. When determining the relative digestibilities of different cellulose allomorphs it is essential to also consider the relative crystallinities of the celluloses being tested. {\textcopyright} 2011 Mittal et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The book is a masterly treatise, reflecting the author's intimate knowledge of his subject. The manufacture and chemical, physical, and physiological properties of nitro compounds of interest in the technology of explosives are given detailed treatment. The explosives materials collection covered by this "cookbook" is not complete, of course. It will never be. It may anyway serve as a convenient guide for all occasional or professional users of explosives showing essentially what is available. Each one of the recipes is only a suggestion. It has been tried in this laboratory and it works, but it does not mean that a variation of the recipe does not work. In fact, the most of the recipes still permit substantial improvements. It may remain to the individual explosives materials chemist to work out such improvements. The book is well worth its relatively modest price and is recommended to all with interest in this interesting and actually little known area. This work touches on: *Nitric Esters - General Outline *Glycerol Trinitrate (Nitroglycerine) *Production of Nitroglycerine *Other Glycerine Esters *Glycol Esters *Monohydroxylic Alcohol Esters *Polyhydroxylic Alcohol Esters *Polyhydroxylic Branched-Chain and Cyclic Alcohol Esters *Cellulose and Nitrocellulose *General Characteristics of Nitrocellulose *Chemical Properties of Nitrocellulose *Nitration of Cellulose *Nitrocellulose Manufacture *Stabilization of Nitrocellulose *Manufacturing Special Types of Nitrocellulose *Nitric Esters of Polysaccharides Other Then Cellulose.

Following digestion, the waste stream is supplemented with domestic raw sewage and a microbially utilizable carbon source and the supplemented waste stream is subjected first to an anaerobic microbial denitrification treatment to eliminate the oxidized forms of nitrogen and then to an aerobic microbial treatment to reduce BOD and to oxidize reduced nitrogen compounds. The effluent therefrom is again supplemented with a microbially utilizable carbon source and subjected to a final anaerobic microbial denitrification to remove nitrates present in the waste water resulting from nitrification processes occurring during the aerobic treatment step.},

abstract = {This effort was a survey of the compatibility of a broad series of representative energetic materials (EM) commonly used in propellants, munitions and explosives with a proposed process of controlled decomposition in water near or above the critical temperature (approximately 373  C). Central issues, in order of consideration, are safety, environmental compatibility of decomposition products, destruction efficiency, extrapolation to compounded formulations of EM, and engineering considerations for scale-up to full-scale operation. The sequence followed in these investigations was (1) initial safety evaluation and small-scale stability tests on each of 13 individual energetic ingredients commonly (all passed this stage); (2) determination of global kinetics and Destruction and Removal Efficiencies (DREs) (destruction was complete - all DREs are limited by sensitivity of detection); (3) identification of products and byproducts of the process to verify environmental compatibility (all tested passed this criterion); and (4) detailed reaction kinetics determinations and development of computational models (qualitatively successful application to nitromethane). An important result was the development of safe and practical means to deliver water-insoluble energetic materials (EM) into the supercritical region These methods included: 1) slurried particles, 2) dissolution in an organic solvent or supercritical carbon dioxide, and 3) digestion in aqueous alkali. A pilot- scale continuous pipe reactor suitable for handling slurried, dissolved, or hydrolyzed explosives was built and tested. Results show that supercritical water is a favorable medium for decomposition of waste and off-spec EM. The process appears to be controllable, and the decomposition products are contained until they are consciously released. Oxides of nitrogen do not form in significant amounts, presumably because the medium supports their decomposition at lower temperatures than does incineration. Digestion in aqueous alkali is a safe and economical pretreatment for most EM. Nickel alloy reactors can be used for formulations that contain only carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. Lined reactors are required for chlorine-containing mixtures and, in general, may be best of long term operation for all EM formulations. Useful detailed kinetic, fluid dynamic, and process modeling for SCW systems is not yet practical. Chemical reaction rates and physical properties data are needed for organic/ inorganic/water mixtures at high temperatures and pressures before models can quantitatively predict reactor operation.},

Available NC fines characterization data vary widely and often conflict with each other because they are based on 'grab samples,' in which the wastewater quality can fluctuate widely. A critical need exists to collect and analyze NC fines characteristics at each sequence for each unit operation over an extended period of time. The U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL) has been evaluating technical alternatives and developing technologies to separate, recycle, and treat NC fines from RAAP manufacturing wastewater. This study characterized the physical properties of NC fines and developed a strategy to prevent pollution with NC fines. Characterized parameters included particle size distribution (PSD), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, zeta potential (particle surface charge), conductivity, and pH. Recommended pollution prevention methods included separation and recycle of NC fines at each process, more effective settling, and in-process modifications.},

In this set, described as 4 31 G, each inner shell is represented by a single basis function taken as a sum of four Gaussians and each valence orbital is split into inner and outer parts described by three and one Gaussian function, respectively. The expansion coefficients and Gaussian exponents are determined by minimizing the total calculated energy of the atomic ground state. This basis set is then used in single determinant molecular orbital studies of a group of small polyatomic molecules. Optimization of valence shell scaling factors shows that considerable rescaling of atomic functions occurs in molecules, the largest effects being observed for hydrogen and carbon. However, the range of optimum scale factors for each atom is small enough to allow the selection of a standard molecular set. The use of this standard basis gives theoretical equilibrium geometries in reasonable agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {A black-box type procedure is presented for the generation of molecule-specific, classical potential energy functions (force-field, FF) solely from quantum mechanically (QM) computed input data. The approach can treat covalently bound molecules and noncovalent complexes with almost arbitrary structure. The necessary QM information consists of the equilibrium structure and the corresponding Hessian matrix, atomic partial charges, and covalent bond orders. The FF fit is performed automatically without any further input and yields a specific (nontransferable) potential which very closely resembles the QM reference potential near the equilibrium. The resulting atomistic, fully flexible FF is anharmonic and allows smooth dissociation of covalent bonds into atoms. A newly proposed force-constant-bond-energy relation with little empiricism provides reasonably accurate (about 5-10{\%} error) atomization energies for almost arbitrary diatomic and polyatomic molecules. Intra- and intermolecular noncovalent interactions are treated by using well established and accurate D3 dispersion coefficients, CM5 charges from small basis set QM calculations, and a new interatomic repulsion potential. Particular attention has been paid to the construction of the torsion potentials which are partially obtained from automatic QM-tight-binding calculations for model systems. Detailed benchmarks are presented for conformational energies, atomization energies, vibrational frequencies, gas phase structures of organic molecules, and transition metal complexes. Comparisons to results from standard FF or semiempirical methods reveal very good accuracy of the new potential. While further studies are necessary to validate the approach, the initial results suggest QMDFF as a routine tool for the computation of a wide range of properties and systems (e.g., for molecular dynamics of isolated molecules, explicit solvation, self-solvation (melting) or even for molecular crystals) in particular when standard parametrizations are unavailable.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis is a very important platform for the use of cellulose; however, the mechanism for the pyrolysis of cellulose is still not clear. A density functional theory (DFT) study was thus conducted to investigate the dehydration of cellulose using cellotriose as a model compound. The DFT study confirms that the location of hydroxyl groups has a significant influence on the dehydration of cellulose. The most active hydroxyl group is  O2H, followed by  O3H and  O6H. The pinacol rearrangement is a more likely mechanism for hydroxyl groups to be dehydrated. However, the barriers for dehydration are so high that dehydration reactions are difficult to occur. To obtain chemical products directly from the pyrolysis of cellulose, species with hydroxyl groups remaining might be targeted. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism of cellulose pyrolysis, especially on the breaking of the glycosidic linkage and the opening of pyran rings.},

While high-resolution crystallographic data have established a solid basis for computational analysis of cellulose, previous work has demonstrated a tendency for modeled microfibrils to diverge from the linear experimental structure and adopt a twisted conformation. Here, we investigate the dependence of this twisting behavior on computational approximations and establish the theoretical basis for its occurrence. We examine the role of solvent, the effect of nonbonded force field parameters [partial charges and van der Waals (vdW) contributions], and the use of explicitly modeled oxygen lone pairs in both the solute and solvent. Findings suggest that microfibril twisting is favored by vdW interactions, and counteracted by both intrachain hydrogen bonds and solvent effects at the microfibril surface.},

The results corroborate the previous studies that levoglucosan (LG) is unlikely the essential intermediate to produce LGO. The most feasible LGO formation pathways from both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose include sequential 1,2-dehydration, six-membered hydrogen transfer and enol-keto tautomerization steps.

abstract = {Charges derived from fitting a classical Coulomb model to quantum mechanical molecular electrostatic potentials (so called ESP-charges) are frequently used in simulations of macromolecules. Simulational methods that use ESP-charges generally reproduce the geometries of hydrogen bonded complexes, despite the fact that these charges are known to overestimate the strengths of these interactions. Through the use of a restraint function during the fitting of the partial charges to the electrostatic potentials the magnitudes of the charges may be attenuated (so called RESP-charges). For the AMBER force field RESP-charges have been proposed for proteins and nucleic acids. Here we examine a novel approach for determining the RESP-charges for carbohydrates based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of crystal structures. During a simulation, the crystallographic unit cell geometry is sensitive to both inter-molecular non-bonded forces and internal torsional rotations. However, for polar molecules, and specifically carbohydrates, the crystal geometries are particularly sensitive to the set of partial atomic charges employed in the simulation. Thus, given a force field in which the van der Waals and torsion terms are well parameterized, it is possible to assess the suitability of a set of partial charges by monitoring the properties of the crystal during an MD simulation. We have examined several charge sets for use with the GLYCAM parameters for carbohydrate and glycoprotein simulations and found that a restraint weight of 0.01 gives the best agreement with the neutron diffraction structure of $\alpha$-d-glucopyranose. Unrestrained ESP-charges performed poorly as did the charges obtained from Mulliken and distributed multipole analyses of the quantum mechanical HF/6-31G* wavefunctions.},

abstract = {The industrial application of nitrocellulose depends on its nitrogen content. When nitrocellulose presents high nitrogen content is used in the manufacture of explosives whereas nitrocellulose with low nitrogen content is used to make a wide range of daily and non-explosive products (e.g. cigarettes, paints, lacquers). This fact makes really important to develop a method for the determination and discrimination of nitrocellulose samples. This work reports, for the first time, the qualitative determination of nitrocellulose previously derivatized with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS) by capillary electrophoresis (CE-LIF) with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF). APTS-labeled nitrocellulose was determined in lowly and highly nitrated nitrocellulose samples present in collodions and smokeless gunpowders, respectively, after their pulverization in liquid nitrogen. The method described enables the visual discrimination of different nitrocelluloses on the basis of the different electrophoretic profiles obtained, and provides a useful tool to determine nitrocellulose. Additionally, the use of field-amplified sample injection (FASI) enabled enhanced sample detection, which made it possible to determine nitrocellulose contained in  15. $\mu$g of gunpowder. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) investigation has been undertaken to explore alkaline hydrolysis mechanisms for nitrocellulose in the gas phase and in bulk water solution by considering the dimer and trimer forms of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose in the (4)C(1) chair conformation and by comparing the computed results with the monomer. Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3   C6   C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

abstract = {In this work, a new approach for the isolation of nitrocellulose from smokeless gunpowders has been developed. A multistep solvent extraction method was needed to purify nitrocellulose contained in gunpowders. For single-base or double-base gunpowders six consecutive solvent extractions were selected: three extractions with methanol (to remove nitroglycerin, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, ethyl-centralite, diphenylamine, and diphenylamine derivatives); one extraction with dichloromethane (to remove colorants and plasticizers of organic nature); one extraction with methanol (to facilitate a final polar extraction); and one extraction with water (to remove ionic components) were necessary at 35 degrees C. For the triple-base gunpowder studied, eight solvent extractions were needed due to a high concentration of the water-soluble nitroguanidine was present. In addition to the same five initial phases used for the single-base and double-base gunpowders, three water extraction phases at a higher temperature (75 degrees C instead of 35 degrees C) were also needed. A final step to solubilize nitrocellulose in methyl ethyl ketone was used to remove inert components (mainly graphite). Nitrocellulose isolated from these propellants was characterized by Fourier-Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR spectroscopy). The same FTIR spectra were observed for nitrocelluloses isolated from different types of gunpowders. A comparison of FTIR spectra of nitrocellulose samples of different nitration degree evidenced that the bands regions most affected by this factor were: 3600-3400cm(-1), corresponding to the stretching vibrations of residual hydroxyl groups; 1200-1000cm(-1), attributed to the valence vibrations nuCO of the glucopyranose cycle; and 750-690cm(-1), assigned to vibrations of the nitrate group. In both cases, the bands appearing in these regions were more pronounced in the spectra of nitrocellulose samples of low nitration degree.},

abstract = {Data on the thermal stability of energetic materials such as nitrocellulose was required in order to obtain safety information for handling, storage and use. In the present study, the thermal stability of four nitrocellulose samples containing various amount of nitrate groups was determined by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetery-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the nitrocellulose occurs in the temperature ranges of 192-209 degrees C. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of compounds indicates that nitrate content of nitrocellulose could has affect on its thermal stability and its decomposition temperature decrease by increasing its nitrogen percent. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C/min) on the DSC behaviour of the nitrocellulose was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperature of the compound was increased. Also, the kinetic parameters such as activation energy and frequency factor for the compound was obtained from the DSC data by non-isothermal methods proposed by ASTM E696 and Ozawa.},

abstract = {In this work, a method to determine the nitrogen content of nitrocellulose from gunpowders and collodions is proposed. A basic hydrolysis of nitrocellulose with 1.0{\%} (m/v) NaOH at 150 C during 30 min was carried out for nitrocellulose from gunpowders (after its previous isolation by a protocol optimized by our research group) and from collodion samples. The concentration of nitrate and nitrite ions in the hydrolysate was determined by ion chromatography with suppression and conductimetric detection. The nitrogen content of nitrocellulose was calculated from the values of the concentration of both ions. The quantitative method was evaluated in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, robustness, limits of detection and quantification, and precision, measured as repeatability and intermediate precision. These parameters were good enough to demonstrate the validity of the method and its applicability to the determination of the nitrogen content of nitrocellulose contained in different types of gunpowders (single- and double-base gunpowders, manufactured from 1944 to 1997) and in commercial collodion samples. For gunpowders, the nitrogen content determined with the optimized method was compared with the values reported by the official label of the ammunition (obtained by a digestion/titration method) and errors, by defect, ranging from 1{\%} to 15.2{\%} (m/m) were calculated. The highest errors were obtained for the oldest gunpowders and could be attributed to the loss of nitro groups in the nitrocellulose molecule during aging. For collodion samples, errors could not be calculated since the real nitrogen content for these samples was not given in the label. In addition, the analysis time (2h for nitrocellulose isolation, 1.5h for nitrocellulose hydrolysis, and 0.2h for chromatographic separation) was about 10 times lower than in the digestion/titration method nowadays used for gunpowder samples.},

abstract = {Due to demilitarization activities in the United States, large amounts of energetic materials which have been accumulated over the years in various manufacturing and military installations, have to be dealt with in an environmentally acceptable manner. Historically, the method of choice for destruction of energetic materials has been open burning or open detonation which are neither safe nor environmentally desirable. Alkaline hydrolysis appears to be a simple, inexpensive method for breaking explosives and propellants down to non-energetic materials that can be directly disposed or further treated biologically. Nitrocellulose is one of the energetic materials classified as reactive (40 CFR 261.21) and is listed under the Resource Conservation {\&} Recovery Act (RCRA). This RCRA classification designates energetic materials as a hazardous waste. This study focused on the kinetics of decomposition of nitrocellulose using sodium hydroxide at different dosage levels, temperature, and contact times. Significant levels of denitration and breakdown of the backbone of cellulose structure were achieved by this method. The post-digestion products consist of organic and inorganic substances with sodium nitrite and nitrate being the major nitrogen containing compounds. The ratio of nitrite-N to nitrate-N is slightly changed at different sodium hydroxide concentrations but it approaches a value of 3 regardless of the degree of digestion. The time required for complete destruction varies with concentration of sodium hydroxide and temperature. Kinetic modeling showed that the process follows a pseudo-first-order rate law. The present work indicates that alkaline digestion may be the technology of choice for the destruction of nitrocellulose in various gun and rocket propellants, and for the treatment of nitrocellulose laden effluents from munitions manufacturing facilities.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose (NC) is a nitrate cellulose ester polymer whose nitrogen content determines its physical and chemical properties and its industrial applications. For the first time, capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to quantify nitrite and nitrate ions released after the alkaline hydrolysis of NC to determine its nitrogen content. This article focuses on the development and validation of the CE method adapted to the determination of these anions in basic matrices in 3 min total runtime. Molybdate anion was used as internal standard. The matrix effect in sodium hydroxide solution was statistically studied, demonstrating that no significant effect occurred in 0.5M sodium hydroxide solution. RSDs on normalized migration times (n=20) were 0.05{\%} for both anions, while RSDs on normalized corrected areas (n=20) were 0.8{\%} and 0.7{\%} for nitrite and nitrate ions, respectively. The selectivity of the CE method was checked in the presence of 10 other anionic species potentially present in post-blast residues. Excellent linearities for normalized corrected areas (R(2){\textgreater}0.999, residual standard deviations of ca 0.05) were obtained for both anions in the range 5-100 mg L(-1). Finally, the optimized CE method was successfully applied to calculate the denitration yields of two NC standards belonging to the non-explosive and explosive classes, and to determine the nitrogen content of a NC contained in a single-base gunpowder. CE, with its speed, low running costs, and simplicity of use, appears as a valuable alternative to ion chromatography for the nitrogen content determination of pure NCs and NC-based explosives, and more generally, for the determination of nitrite and nitrate ions in other highly alkaline matrices.},

abstract = {A non-destructive UV Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the  ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time' plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40  C, 50  C, 60  C and 70  C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 {\textgreater} C2 {\textgreater} C3.},

The dye acts as a stabilizer and is slowly depleted as a result of its reaction with NOx from the breakdown of the nitrate ester groups on NC.

Our results suggest dramatically different time scales for convergence of properties of interest, which is important in the design of computational studies and comparisons to experimental data. This study highlights that further experimental and theoretical work is required to understand the structure of small diameter cellulose microfibrils typical of plant cellulose.},

abstract = {An adhesive based on cellulose nitrate has been used in the British Museum for the repair of antiquities since cellulose nitrate plastic was first made commercially available. The use of cellulose nitrate adhesives in conservation has been criticized, and for this reason, the stability of the adhesive currently in use was investigated. The properties of artificially aged samples of the adhesive were compared with those of artificially aged adhesive-grade cellulose nitrate. The results indicate that the degradation of cellulose nitrate is substantially retarded by the plasticizer in the adhesive. Samples of cellulose nitrate adhesive taken from joins in objects where the date of conservation work is known were analyzed. The results were compared with the analysis of the artificially aged samples, and a relationship between natural and artificial aging of cellulose nitrate adhesive was established. The results of this investigation indicate that cellulose nitrate adhesives are stable for at least 30 years, and may be extrapolated to suggest a lifetime of 50 to 100 years under museum conditions in a temperate climate.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose (NC) aerogel was prepared by sol-gel synthetic approach and supercritical carbon dioxide drying method as a new energetic matrix for nano-composite energetic materials. Scanning electron microscopy of the NC aerogel reveals that the aerogel is accumulated by nanoparticles with a diameter of 30-50 nm and has nano-porous structure, which makes the thermal behavior of the NC aerogel different from that of the NC fibers. Therefore, the thermal properties of NC aerogel were determined by TG/DSC, which showed that the maximum decomposition temperature and the exothermic peak temperature of NC aerogel decreased 8.2 and 11.4 degrees C than NC fibers, respectively. By TG/FTIR technology combined FTIR test of the condensed phase, the decomposition mechanism was derived based on the experimental results. The initial reaction of NC aerogel decomposition is the splitting of urethane bond, and then, the scission of -O-NO2 bonds happens. Moreover, the macromolecular chains' scission site of NC aerogel firstly occurs at -C-O-C- in the ring, while the chains of NC fibers break at -C-O-C- between the rings.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose based (NC) and nitroglycerin based (NG) propellants often have a fixed acid and water content during the manufacturing time. After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a a complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a it complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters. Correlation between heat flow curve, stabilizer depletion and free-radical distribution has been evaluated. An intramolecular decomposition mechanism is preferred, because it prevents the possibility that the NOx from NNODPA or NNDPA may interact with the NC and NG again during the rearrangement process. Since the acidity of the propellant composition continues to change during the aging process, multiple mechanisms may proceed simultaneously.},

Geometries of reactant complexes, transition states, intermediates, and completely denitrated product were optimized at the density functional theory (DFT) level using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The effect of bulk water was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. The nature of the potential energy surface of the local minima and transition states was ascertained through vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were also performed to validate the computed transition state structures. Effect of electron correlation on computed energies was considered through a single point energy calculation at the MP2 level using the cc-pVTZ basis set. It was revealed that the presence of hydrogen bonds between the attacking OH  ion and various hydrogen bond donating sites (including CH sites) of monomer was necessary for stabilization of the transition state. It was revealed that the $\alpha$-anomer will be more reactive than the $\beta$-anomer with regard to the denitration reaction. The role of entropy and the denitration ability of various sites are also discussed.},

abstract = {Cellulose nitrate (or nitrocellulose) has received considerable interest due to its uses in various applications, such as paints, photographic films and propellants. However, it is considered as one of the primary pollutants in the energetic material industries because it can be degraded to form polluting chemical species. In this work, the UV light degradation of cellulose nitrate films was studied under conditions of artificially accelerated photooxidation. To eliminate the reactivity of nitro groups, the degradation of ethylcellulose was also investigated. Infrared spectroscopy analyses of the chemical modifications caused by the photooxidation of cellulose nitrate films and the resulting formation of volatile products revealed the occurrence of de-nitration and the formation of oxidation photoproducts exhibiting lactone and anhydride functions. The impact of these chemical modifications on the mechanical and thermal properties of cellulose nitrate films includes embrittlement and lower temperatures of ignition when used as a propellant. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The migration of the energetic plasticisers 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane; 2,4-dinitroethylbenzene; and 2,4,6-trinitroethylbenzene in two nitrocellulose binder mixtures has been investigated by the calculation of diffusion coefficients and activation energies of diffusion from molecular dynamics simulations. The study included parameterisation of force fields for nitrocellulose; 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane; the stabilizer ethyl centralite; and the overall nitrocellulose binder mixtures. Simulated densities obtained were in very good agreement with experimental densities. The diffusion coefficients compare favourably with experimental values available for similar systems, when differences such as the proportions of plasticisers are taken into consideration. Examination of the plasticiser diffusion rates suggests that 1-nitramino-2,3-dinitroxypropane migrates more slowly from a nitrocellulose binder than 2,4-dinitroethylbenzene for the nitrocellulose and plasticiser proportions used in this study. Understanding plasticiser migration is essential for the long-term storage of energetic material formulations without significant changes occurring in their properties or compositions.},

H.; Nimlos, M. R.; Davis, M.; Johnson, D. K.; Himmel, M. E. Carbohydr. Res. 2005, 340, 2319-2327]. In addition, simulation results showed that water molecules could participate in the sugar reactions, thus altering the reaction pathways. In the present study, the temperature and water density effects on the sugar degradation pathways were investigated with CPMD. We found that changes in both temperature and water density could profoundly affect the mechanisms and pathways. We attributed these effects to both the strength of hydrogen bonding and proton affinity of water. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this work, the equilibrium geometry and the corresponding rotational barrier of the benzene ring for each furan derivative conformation were calculated by DFT methods. The trend and shape of the rotational barrier are rationalized within natural bond orbitals as well as atoms-in-molecules approach. For the corresponding equilibrium geometries, 1H and 13C substituent induced shifts (SIS) were calculated and compared with experimental values. Calculated shielding constants are shown to be sensitive to the substituent effect through a linear fit with substituent's Hammett constants. An alternative approach was followed for assessing the effect of substituents over SIS through comparing the differences in isotropic shielding constants with NBO charges as well as with 1H and 13C experimental chemical shifts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{FernandezdelaOssa2011,
abstract = {This work presents an updated overview of the analytical techniques used to study highly-nitrated nitrocellulose, which is used in explosives and is of forensic interest. Most articles published in the past decade were designed: (1) to investigate polymeric parameters of nitrocellulose (e.g., molar mass distribution, viscosity and specific refractive index) by size-exclusion chromatography; (2) to determine the morphological and thermal characteristics of nitrocellulose using thermal and spectroscopic techniques; and, (3) to study the thermal, biological and mechanical degradation of nitrocellulose by thermal, spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric (MS) techniques, alone or coupled to gas chromatography. However, the few papers that focused on the determination of nitrocellulose used in explosives employed analytical techniques [e.g., vibrational techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy), MS and ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and liquid chromatography (LC) (high-performance LC and ion chromatography)]. Most of the information reported by these techniques has been qualitative. Only quantitative determination of nitrocellulose or its nitrogen content has been performed by measuring the nitrite and/or nitrate ions released from its basic hydrolysis.},

HMF is a critical intermediate for biomass conversion to biofuels. It was found that protonation of the C2-OH on glucose, the breakage of the C2-O2 bond, and the formation of the C2-O5 bond is the critical rate-limiting step for the direct glucose conversion to HMF without converting to fructose first, contrary to the wide-spread assumption in literature that fructose is the main intermediate for glucose conversion to HMF. The calculated reaction barrier of 30-35 kcal/mol appears to be solvent-induced and is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Arenas2007,
abstract = {Potential energy surfaces, minimum energy reaction paths, minima, transition states, reaction barriers, and conical intersections for the most important atmospheric reactions of methyl nitrate (CH3ONO 2) and methylperoxy nitrite (CH3OONO) on the electronic ground state have been studied (i) with the second-order multiconfigurational perturbation theory (CASPT2) by computation of numerical energy gradients for stationary points and (ii) with the density functional theory (DFT). The proposed mechanism explains the conversion of unreactive alkyl peroxy radicals into alkoxy radicals: CH3O2 + NO   CH 3OONO   CH3O + NO2   CH 3ONO2. Additionally, several discrepancies found in the comparison of the results obtained from the two employed approaches are analyzed. CASPT2 predicts that all dissociation reactions into radicals occur without an extra exit energy barrier. In contrast, DFT finds transition states for the dissociations of cis- and transmethylperoxy nitrite into CH3O + NO2. Furthermore, multiconfigurational methods [CASPT2 and complete active space SCF (CAS-SCF)] predict the isomerization of CH 3ONO2 to CH3OONO to occur in a two-step mechanism: (i) CH3ONO2   CH3O + NO 2; and (ii) CH3O + NO2   CH 3OONO. The reason for this has to do with the coupling of the ground electronic state with the first excited state. Therefore, it is demonstrated that DFT methods based on single determinantal wave functions give an incorrect picture of the aforementioned reaction mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

@article{DaSilva2013,
abstract = {The mechanism of neutral hydrolysis of ester has long been explored by theoretical studies. However, reliable theoretical calculations show that the usual bifunctional catalysis mechanism reported by different authors cannot explain the experimental kinetics. An important advance was recently reported by Gunaydin and Houk, suggesting that ions are involved in the mechanism and the process initiates by water autoionization followed by protonation of the ester (WAIA mechanism). However, this mechanism does not explain the hydrolysis of activated esters. In this work, we have used ab initio calculations, continuum solvation models, and intrinsic reaction coordinate method to support the WAIA mechanism for normal ester. In the case of activated esters, the process can also be viewed as water autoionization with formation of hydroxide ion aided by a second water molecule acting as a general base (WAIB mechanism). This is the mechanism that was proposed by Jencks and Carriuolo 50 years ago. Our analysis point out that the usual method for exploring mechanisms, searching for saddle points, may not work for problems like the present one, since there are no saddle points on the reaction pathway. Rather, the formation of a pair of ions from a neutral species may have an asymptotic barrier. The approach used in this paper allows the calculation of the free energy profile and enable us to explain the mechanism and kinetics of the neutral hydrolysis of normal (methyl acetate) and activated (methyl trifluoroacetate) esters. In addition, the present study suggests that formation of a pair of ions should always be considered in reactions in aqueous solution. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Protonation of C1-OH on the $\beta$-d-glucose, breakage of the C1-O1 bond, and the formation of C1 carbocation is the rate-limiting step. The effects of solvent on the reaction were investigated by determining the FES both in the absence and presence of solvent water. It was found that water played a critical role in these reactions. The reaction barrier for the proton-catalyzed glucose condensation reaction is solvent induced because of proton's high affinity for water. During these simulations, $\beta$-d-glucose conversion to $\alpha$-d-glucose process via the C1 carbocation was also observed. The associated free energy change and activation barrier for this reaction were determined. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Jebber1996,
abstract = {Protonations of alpha- and beta-D-glucopyranose in the gas phase were investigated using the ab initio molecular orbital approach at the HF/6-31G* level with full geometry optimization. Minimum-energy structures of three neutral and six protonated species for each anomer were calculated, Geometries, energies, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these structures are discussed. For the neutral species at 298 K the order of stability for the hydroxymethyl conformers is calculated to be GT {\textgreater} CG {\textgreater} TG for the a anomer and GG {\textgreater} CT {\textgreater} TG fur the beta anomer. Protonated species that least disrupt the internal hydrogen bonding network in the neutral species are considered: these include protonations on the oxygen sites labeled as the hydroxymethyl O6, the ring O5, and the exocylic hydroxyl O4. The O6 protonation in the TG conformation is electronically most favored. Energy corrections fur basis-set deficiency and electron-correlation omission in the adopted theoretical procedure were estimated from high-level calculations on ethanol, 2-propanol, and dimethyl ether. In addition, the gas-phase basicity (GB) of glucose was measured by proton transfer reactions in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The experimental GB values for both anomers were determined to be 188 +/- 3 kcal/mol. The experimental values are compared with the ab initio estimates of 178-190 and 177-189 kcal/mol for the respective alpha and beta anomers. Theoretical structures for the lowest-electronic-energy protonated species in the three hydroxymethyl conformations of each anomer are also presented to serve as reference data for postulating various kinetic pathways.
