abstract = {Levoglucosenone (LGO) is a valuable anhydrosugar product from fast pyrolysis of cellulose/biomass, but its formation mechanism is still unclear at present. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to examine the different LGO formation pathways from pyrolysis of both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose, and the most favorable pathways were clarified. The results corroborate the previous studies that levoglucosan (LG) is unlikely the essential intermediate to produce LGO. The most feasible LGO formation pathways from both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose include sequential 1,2-dehydration, six-membered hydrogen transfer and enol-keto tautomerization steps. Enol-keto tautomerization is the rate-determining steps for both reactions to form LGO.},

abstract = {Abstract. The presence of alcohol, organonitrate, and organosulfate species related to the gaseous precursor isoprene in ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has stimulated investigations of the nature of SOA-phase chemical processing. Recent work has suggested that certain isoprene-derived organonitrates are able to efficiently convert to organosulfates and alcohols on ambient SOA. In order to better understand the structure activity relationships previously observed for the isoprene-derived organonitrates and organosulfates, the hydrolysis reactions of a number of monofunctional and difunctional organonitrates and organosulfates with varying carbon substitution properties were investigated. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to study the bulk phase aqueous reactions of these organonitrates and organosulfates in order to determine hydrolysis reaction rate and, in some cases, thermodynamics information. Electronic structure calculations were also carried out to determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for these species, and for the previously studied isoprene-derived species. The results suggest that while organonitrates and organosulfates are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the corresponding alcohols at standard state, only the tertiary organonitrates (and perhaps some tertiary organosulfates) are able to efficiently hydrolyze on SOA timescales and acidities.},

Disposing of obsolete and waste propellants in this manner could be both cost-effective and environmentally sound, and as an added benefit would utilize the energy value of these materials. Tests were conducted to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics, as well as the chemical compatability, of nitrocellulose (NC)—solvent—No. 2 fuel oil solutions. Acetone, ethyl acetate, and butyl acetate were tested as solvents for NC. The results from these tests, coupled with an economic analysis, indicated that salvation of NC with the best solvent tested, acetone, and mixing with No. 2 fuel oil was not technically feasible or cost effective due to the low solubility of the NC. However, the economic analysis did indicate potential cost effectiveness using propellant—No. 2 fuel oil slurries as supplemental fuels.},

abstract = {Different DFT methods give relative energies for models of the FeMo cluster in nitrogenase that differ by up to 600 kJ mol −1 . This is 4–30 times more than what is observed for other systems and explain why previous computational studies have given conflicting results. It is caused by differences in the oxidation state of the metals and the number of Fe–C, Fe–S and Fe–H bonds, connected to the amount of static correlation. Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can cleave the triple bond in N 2 , making nitrogen avaiable for other organisms. It contains a complicated MoFe 7 S 9 C(homocitrate) cluster in its active site. Many computational studies with density-functional theory (DFT) of the nitrogenase enzyme have been presented, but they do not show any consensus – they do not even agree where the first four protons should be added, forming the central intermediate E 4 . We show that the prime reason for this is that different DFT methods give relative energies that differ by almost 600 kJ mol −1 for different protonation states. This is 4–30 times more than what is observed for other systems. The reason for this is that in some structures, the hydrogens bind to sulfide or carbide ions as protons, whereas in other structures they bind to the metals as hydride ions, changing the oxidation state of the metals, as well as the Fe–C, Fe–S and Fe–Fe distances. The energies correlate with the amount of Hartree–Fock exchange in the method, indicating a variation in the amount of static correlation in the structures. It is currently unclear which DFT method gives the best results for nitrogenase. We show that non-hybrid DFT functionals and TPSSh give the most accurate structures of the resting active site, whereas B3LYP and PBE0 give the best H 2 dissociation energies. However, no DFT method indicates that a structure of E 4 with two bridging hydride ions is lowest in energy, as spectroscopic experiments indicate.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose based (NC) and nitroglycerin based (NG) propellants often have a fixed acid and water content during the manufacturing time. After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a a complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a it complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters. Correlation between heat flow curve, stabilizer depletion and free-radical distribution has been evaluated. An intramolecular decomposition mechanism is preferred, because it prevents the possibility that the NOx from NNODPA or NNDPA may interact with the NC and NG again during the rearrangement process. Since the acidity of the propellant composition continues to change during the aging process, multiple mechanisms may proceed simultaneously.},

However, adjacent sugar rings alternate in conformation giving the chain a cellobiosyl repeat. The chains organize in sheets packed in a "parallel-up" fashion. The positions of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding were determined from a Fourier-difference analysis using neutron diffraction data collected from hydrogenated and deuterated samples.

abstract = {Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

OBJECTIVE: Develop a composite propellant which has an extended plateau region in its burning rate vs. pressure relationship curve, as well as minimized variation in ballistic performance as a function of temperature change. DESCRIPTION: Double base (nitrocellulose {\&} nitroglycerine based) propellants widely used in Navy aircraft ejection seat systems experience degradation and depletion of the stabilizers used in the formulation over time with exposure to high operational and storage temperatures. This degradation results in safety risks due to the possibility of inadvertent spontaneous deflagration of the propellant. Current composite propellants typically do not have a pronounced plateau in their burning rate vs. pressure curves, and have a wider variation in performance with changes in temperature as compared to double base propellants. An innovative composite propellant to replace the current double based propellants used must be nitrate ester free and thermally stable across an operating temperature range from -65 degrees F to +200 degrees F. Ideally the propellant burning rate in the plateau region at ambient temperature would be approximately 1.0 inches per second at 2000 pounds per square inch (psi), followed by a negative slope in the burning rate curve, extending through at least 4500 to 5000 psi, and dropping by at least 0.4 inches per second. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Sigma sub p) would ideally be sp = 0.1 {\%}/ K or less. Such a composite propellant would have performance characteristics similar to a plateau burning double base propellant, currently in use in Naval ejection seat systems, but without the limited life inherent in propellants containing nitrate esters. This formulation would be developed and validated through adjustments to the propellant composition, followed by burning rate testing to demonstrate the effects of adjustments made. The burning rates of the final formulation supplied to the Navy will be measured at -65F, ambient temperature, and +200F across the pressure range of 500 to 5000 PSI. The formulation must contain ingredients which have been tested to demonstrate compatibility with each other. Mechanical properties testing, as well as basic propellant safety and characterization tests in accordance with NAVSEAINST 8020.5C are to be conducted, so a Department of Defense Interim Hazard Classification can be obtained for the propellant. The tests would be conducted on zero-time and propellant samples aged for 64 days at 200F, and the results supplied to the Navy. PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of the composite propellant developed in accordance with the identified parameters. PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate through testing, a formulation which meets the performance objectives for burning rate and temperature sensitivity across the pressure range on zero-time and aged propellant samples. Characterization tests, scale up of the propellant manufacturing process, and manufacture of a quantity of propellant samples, one to two kilograms, for delivery to the Navy would also be performed in Phase II. PHASE III: Conduct the complete propellant characterization testing per NAVSEAINST 8020.5C and manufacture and transition a quantity of propellant samples for delivery to the Navy for testing. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: A composite propellant developed under this effort could be used in commercial mining, blasting, oil and gas exploration cartridge applications where consistent performance is required across a wide variation in temperature.

We demonstrate how the synergistic activity of cellulases was enhanced by altering the hydrogen bond network within crystalline cellulose fibrils. We provide a molecular-scale explanation of these phenomena through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enzymatic assays. Ammonia transformed the naturally occurring crystalline allomorph I$\beta$ to IIII, which led to a decrease in the number of cellulose intrasheet hydrogen bonds and an increase in the number of intersheet hydrogen bonds. This rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within cellulose IIII, which increased the number of solvent-exposed glucan chain hydrogen bonds with water by ∼50{\%}, was accompanied by enhanced saccharification rates by up to 5-fold (closest to amorphous cellulose) and 60–70{\%} lower maximum surface-bound cellulase capacity.

@article{Moniruzzaman2014,
abstract = {A non-destructive UV–Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO–NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV–Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time' plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO–NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO–NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO–NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO–NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 {\textgreater} C2 {\textgreater} C3.},
