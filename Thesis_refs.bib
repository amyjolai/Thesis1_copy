abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) investigation has been undertaken to explore alkaline hydrolysis mechanisms for nitrocellulose in the gas phase and in bulk water solution by considering the dimer and trimer forms of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose in the (4)C(1) chair conformation and by comparing the computed results with the monomer. Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3 → C6 → C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

abstract = {A non-destructive UV–Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO–NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV–Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time' plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO–NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO–NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO–NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO–NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 {\textgreater} C2 {\textgreater} C3.},

abstract = {Levoglucosenone (LGO) is a valuable anhydrosugar product from fast pyrolysis of cellulose/biomass, but its formation mechanism is still unclear at present. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to examine the different LGO formation pathways from pyrolysis of both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose, and the most favorable pathways were clarified. The results corroborate the previous studies that levoglucosan (LG) is unlikely the essential intermediate to produce LGO. The most feasible LGO formation pathways from both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose include sequential 1,2-dehydration, six-membered hydrogen transfer and enol-keto tautomerization steps. Enol-keto tautomerization is the rate-determining steps for both reactions to form LGO.},
