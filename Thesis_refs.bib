abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) investigation has been undertaken to explore alkaline hydrolysis mechanisms for nitrocellulose in the gas phase and in bulk water solution by considering the dimer and trimer forms of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose in the (4)C(1) chair conformation and by comparing the computed results with the monomer. Ground and transition state geometries were optimized using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set both in the gas phase and in the bulk water solution. The nature of respective potential energy surfaces was ascertained through harmonic vibrational frequency analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed to ensure that computed transition state connects to the respective reactants and products. Single-point energy calculations were also performed using the recently developed M06-2X functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3 $\r$\rightarrow$ C6 $$\rightarrow$ C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

abstract = {A non-destructive UV–Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO–NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV–Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time' plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO–NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO–NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO–NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO–NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 {\textgreater} C2 {\textgreater} C3.},

The most feasible LGO formation pathways from both $\beta$-d-glucopyranose and cellobiose include sequential 1,2-dehydration, six-membered hydrogen transfer and enol-keto tautomerization steps.

OBJECTIVE: Develop a composite propellant which has an extended plateau region in its burning rate vs. pressure relationship curve, as well as minimized variation in ballistic performance as a function of temperature change. DESCRIPTION: Double base (nitrocellulose {\&} nitroglycerine based) propellants widely used in Navy aircraft ejection seat systems experience degradation and depletion of the stabilizers used in the formulation over time with exposure to high operational and storage temperatures. This degradation results in safety risks due to the possibility of inadvertent spontaneous deflagration of the propellant. Current composite propellants typically do not have a pronounced plateau in their burning rate vs. pressure curves, and have a wider variation in performance with changes in temperature as compared to double base propellants. An innovative composite propellant to replace the current double based propellants used must be nitrate ester free and thermally stable across an operating temperature range from -65 degrees F to +200 degrees F. Ideally the propellant burning rate in the plateau region at ambient temperature would be approximately 1.0 inches per second at 2000 pounds per square inch (psi), followed by a negative slope in the burning rate curve, extending through at least 4500 to 5000 psi, and dropping by at least 0.4 inches per second. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Sigma sub p) would ideally be sp = 0.1 {\%}/ K or less. Such a composite propellant would have performance characteristics similar to a plateau burning double base propellant, currently in use in Naval ejection seat systems, but without the limited life inherent in propellants containing nitrate esters. This formulation would be developed and validated through adjustments to the propellant composition, followed by burning rate testing to demonstrate the effects of adjustments made. The burning rates of the final formulation supplied to the Navy will be measured at -65F, ambient temperature, and +200F across the pressure range of 500 to 5000 PSI. The formulation must contain ingredients which have been tested to demonstrate compatibility with each other. Mechanical properties testing, as well as basic propellant safety and characterization tests in accordance with NAVSEAINST 8020.5C are to be conducted, so a Department of Defense Interim Hazard Classification can be obtained for the propellant. The tests would be conducted on zero-time and propellant samples aged for 64 days at 200F, and the results supplied to the Navy. PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of the composite propellant developed in accordance with the identified parameters. PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate through testing, a formulation which meets the performance objectives for burning rate and temperature sensitivity across the pressure range on zero-time and aged propellant samples. Characterization tests, scale up of the propellant manufacturing process, and manufacture of a quantity of propellant samples, one to two kilograms, for delivery to the Navy would also be performed in Phase II. PHASE III: Conduct the complete propellant characterization testing per NAVSEAINST 8020.5C and manufacture and transition a quantity of propellant samples for delivery to the Navy for testing. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: A composite propellant developed under this effort could be used in commercial mining, blasting, oil and gas exploration cartridge applications where consistent performance is required across a wide variation in temperature.

abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilib...},

abstract = {The lack of fundamental understanding of the intricate interplay between large amounts of chemical energy stored in energetic molecular materials and their sensitivity to detonation initiation represents a stubborn outstanding challenge. This study sheds much needed light on the atomic decomposition mechanisms of nitroesters with an example of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (C5H8N4O12, also known as PETN), used as an explosive and a medication. The performed study is based on density functional theory combined with variational transition-state theory and large-scale massively parallel periodic supercell calculations and presents a detailed analysis of thermal initiation of chemical reactions and their kinetics in the gas-phase PETN molecules, the ideal bulk crystals, and on two low energy surfaces, (101) and (110). The obtained activation barriers, reaction energies, and reaction rates of simulated bond dissociation mechanisms reveal that the overall decomposition of condensed nitroesters is defined by the ...},

@article{Hanwell2012,
abstract = {Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

abstract = {Nitrocellulose (NC) aerogel was prepared by sol-gel synthetic approach and supercritical carbon dioxide drying method as a new energetic matrix for nano-composite energetic materials. Scanning electron microscopy of the NC aerogel reveals that the aerogel is accumulated by nanoparticles with a diameter of 30-50 nm and has nano-porous structure, which makes the thermal behavior of the NC aerogel different from that of the NC fibers. Therefore, the thermal properties of NC aerogel were determined by TG/DSC, which showed that the maximum decomposition temperature and the exothermic peak temperature of NC aerogel decreased 8.2 and 11.4 degrees C than NC fibers, respectively. By TG/FTIR technology combined FTIR test of the condensed phase, the decomposition mechanism was derived based on the experimental results. The initial reaction of NC aerogel decomposition is the splitting of urethane bond, and then, the scission of -O-NO2 bonds happens. Moreover, the macromolecular chains' scission site of NC aerogel firstly occurs at -C-O-C- in the ring, while the chains of NC fibers break at -C-O-C- between the rings.},

abstract = {Conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels is partly inefficient due to the deleterious impact of cellulose crystallinity on enzymatic saccharification. We demonstrate how the synergistic activity of cellulases was enhanced by altering the hydrogen bond network within crystalline cellulose fibrils. We provide a molecular-scale explanation of these phenomena through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enzymatic assays. Ammonia transformed the naturally occurring crystalline allomorph I$\beta$ to IIII, which led to a decrease in the number of cellulose intrasheet hydrogen bonds and an increase in the number of intersheet hydrogen bonds. This rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within cellulose IIII, which increased the number of solvent-exposed glucan chain hydrogen bonds with water by ∼50{\%}, was accompanied by enhanced saccharification rates by up to 5-fold (closest to amorphous cellulose) and 60–70{\%} lower maximum surface-bound cellulase capacity. The enhancement in apparent cellulase activity was attrib...},

In the metal can, denitration products react with iron to form a very basic iron-nitrogen oxide compound in large quantities, which catalyses further breakdown. The iron itself also acts as a catalyst.

@article{Chin2007,
abstract = {Nitrocellulose based (NC) and nitroglycerin based (NG) propellants often have a fixed acid and water content during the manufacturing time. After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a a complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a it complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters. Correlation between heat flow curve, stabilizer depletion and free-radical distribution has been evaluated. An intramolecular decomposition mechanism is preferred, because it prevents the possibility that the NOx from NNODPA or NNDPA may interact with the NC and NG again during the rearrangement process. Since the acidity of the propellant composition continues to change during the aging process, multiple mechanisms may proceed simultaneously.},
