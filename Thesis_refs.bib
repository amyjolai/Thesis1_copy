abstract = {The use of inorganic stabilizers for double-base propellants in literature is scanty; therefore five samples (S 1-S 5) of different percentages (2-4{\%}) of nano-clinoptilolite were investigated as new inorganic stabilizers for double-base propellants (DBPs). The grain size of clinoptilolite stabilizer played an important role in the stabilization effect. As the grain size of stabilizer decreases, the surface area of stabilizer increases and the ability to absorb pronounce amount of hazardous nitrogen oxides increases. In this work clinoptilolite in nano-scale (30nm) has been used to obtain higher stabilizing effect for DBPs. The evaluation process has been performed through the classical thermal stability tests (Bergmann-Junk and calorimetric tests), in comparison with thermal analyses measurements (TGA and DSC) and kinetic parameters calculation such as activation energy (E a), enthalpy of activation ($\Delta$H *), Gibbs free energy of activation ($\Delta$G *), entropy of activation ($\Delta$S *) and frequency factor (A), which calculated using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The results for the new stabilizers were compared with that for the classical one (N,N-diethyldiphenyl urea, C 1). It has been found that the samples containing new stabilizer with percentages (3.0, 3.5 and 4.0{\%}) showed better stability effect for DBPs than the classical one. The efficiency of stabilization of each inorganic stabilizer to DBPs is also rationalized and correlated with its structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {T-Jump/FTIR and T-jump/Raman spectroscopies were used to analyze the gaseous products from six nitrate esters which were rapidly heated (2000 C/s nominal) to set temperatures in the 250 to 500 C range while maintaining a pressure of 5 atm Ar. The compounds studied were nitroglycerin (NG), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN), trimethanolethane trinitrate (TMETN), triethyleneglycol dinitrate (TEGDN), and bis(nitratomethyl) oxetane (BNMO). The atom balances were determined using all of the gaseous decomposition products based on quantitation by multivariate regression methods. With few exceptions, the oxygen balance of the nitrate ester correlated with the temperature dependence of the products, the CO2/CO ratio, the NO/CO ratio, and the amounts of H2O and total hydrocarbon liberated. The amounts of NO2 and CH2O scaled with the number of -NO2 groups and -CH2O- units in the parent molecule. The relation between the composition of the parent nitrate ester and the gaseous products from pyrolysis is the most straightforward of the various classes of oxidizing energetic functional groups studied to date. Some degree of vaporization of the parent nitrate ester was observed upon flash heating. The IR-active modes of NG and BTTN in the gaseous phase were assigned by calculation of their frequencies by density functional theory in the energy-minimized structure.},

@article{Freedman2002,
abstract = {Waste nitrocellulose (NC) is regulated as a hazardous material. The objective of this study was to determine if NC exposed to denitrifying and sulfidogenic conditions would undergo sufficient removal of the nitro groups to yield a material that is no longer explosive. Enrichment cultures were established with methanol as the electron donor for nitrate-reducing conditions and lactate for sulfate-reducing conditions. NC was added to the cultures at 10 g/l. A statistically significant decrease in the nitrogen (N) content of NC occurred in both enrichment cultures, from approximately 13.1 13.2{\%} in virgin NC to 12.2 12.4{\%}. This was accompanied by an increase in nitrogen gas formation. The presence of a primary substrate (methanol and lactate) was necessary to affect this change; NC itself did not serve as an electron donor. In cultures that were carrying out denitrification but were then depleted of nitrate, with methanol still present, a slightly greater removal of nitro groups from NC occurred along with additional formation of nitrogen gas. NC did not have an inhibitory affect on the denitrification process but it did significantly slow the rate of lactate consumption and sulfate reduction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that NC exposed to denitrifying conditions was enriched in hydroxyl groups, consistent with removal of some of the nitro groups by hydrolysis of the nitrate esters. NC exposed to nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions and virgin NC were also compared based on their explosive properties using a small-scale burning test. The biologically treated NC exhibited somewhat less reactivity, but was still rated as explosive. The decrease in{\%}N, increase in N2, and FTIR results demonstrated that NC does undergo biotransformation in the presence of nitrate- and sulfate-reducing enrichment cultures, but the extent of denitration does not appear to be adequate to yield a nonhazardous product.},

Experimental findings revealed that the most important fire properties such as ignition time, mass loss rate and ash content exhibited significant differences between the two structures of NC. Compared with the soft fiber NC, chip NC possesses a lower fire hazard, and its heat release rate intensity (HRRI) is mainly affected by the sample mass.

abstract = {This chapter is concerned with plastics based on cellulose, produced from either cotton linters or wood pulp. They have the advantage of being produced from a renewable source. Cellulose itself is both crystalline and hydrogen bonded, so is insoluble and cannot be melted. In order to process cellulose, it must be reacted to produce cellulose esters or ethers. Alternatively, it can be modified to become soluble, then converted back to cellulose, when it is known as regenerated cellulose, and used for films or fibers. Esters (e.g.,cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose propionate) are also unprocessable, and hence are modified with plasticizers. Their properties depend on extent of esterification, molar mass, and, particularly, plasticizer level. Applications are in those areas where appearance and toughness are important, such as ophthalmics, toys and sports goods, and spectacle frames. Ethyl cellulose is the only ether used as a plastic material.},

The experimental determination of the activation energies is particularly difficult when several possible reaction pathways coexist in the thermal decomposition. Ab initio calculations intended to provide an interpretation of the experiment are often of little help if they produce only the activation barriers and ignore the kinetics of the decomposition process. To overcome this ambiguity, a theoretical study of a complete picture of gas phase thermo-decomposition, including reaction energies, activation barriers, and reaction rates, is illustrated with the example of the $\beta$-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) molecule by means of quantum-chemical calculations.

The B3LYP atom equivalents of carbon and hydrogen derived from stable hydrocarbons were used without adjustment to calculate the enthalpies of formation of some free radicals and carbocations.

The energetics of five dehydration and two isomerization pathways were examined for the protonated form of BP in acidic aqueous solutions and the most favorable pathway of these was found to be the dehydration at the anomeric site. No dehydration pathway of OC glucose is favored over its isomerization to BP or to fructose. The relative ease of dehydration over isomerization depends on the selection of the reaction media for the protonated form of BP. These two reaction pathways catalyzed by a surface Br{\"{o}}nsted acid site were then examined and the isomerization pathway was found to be more favorable than dehydration at the anomeric site on a surface acid site.

abstract = {The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most powerful synthetic tools in organic chemistry, and asymmetric Diels-Alder catalysis allows for rapid construction of chiral carbon sca olds. For this reason, considerable e ort has been invested in developing e cient and stereoselective organo- and biocatalysts. However, Diels-Alder is a virtually unknown reaction in Nature, and to engineer an enzyme into a Diels-Alderase is therefore a challenging task. Despite several successful designs of catalytic antibodies since the 1980's, their catalytic activities have remained low, and no true arti cial 'Diels-Alderase' enzyme was reported before 2010.

In this thesis, we employ state-of-the-art computational tools to study the mechanism of organocatalyzed Diels-Alder in detail, and to redesign existing enzymes into intermolecular Diels-Alder catalysts. Papers I IV explore the mechanistic variations when employing increasingly activated reactants and the e ect of catalysis. In particular, the relation between the traditionally presumed concerted mechanism and a stepwise pathway, forming one bond at a time, is probed. Papers V X deal with enzyme design and the computational aspects of predicting catalytic activity. Four novel, computationally designed Diels-Alderase candidates are presented in Papers VI IX. In Paper X, a new parameterization of the Linear Interaction Energy model for predicting protein-ligand a nities is presented.

A general  nding in this thesis is that it is di cult to attain large transition state stabilization e ects solely by hydrogen bond catalysis. In addition, water (the preferred solvent of enzymes) is well-known for catalyzing Diels- Alder by itself. Therefore, an e cient Diels-Alderase must rely on large binding a nities for the two substrates and preferential binding conformations close to the transition state geometry. In Papers VI VIII, we co-designed the enzyme active site and substrates in order to achieve the best possible complementarity and maximize binding a nity and pre-organization. Even so, catalysis is limited by the maximum possible stabilization o ered by hydrogen bonds, and by the inherently large energy barrier associated with the [4+2] cycloaddition.

The stepwise Diels-Alder pathway, proceeding via a zwitterionic intermediate, may o er a productive alternative for enzyme catalysis, since an enzyme active site may be more di erentiated towards stabilizing the high-energy states than for the standard mechanism. In Papers I and III, it is demonstrated that a hydrogen bond donor catalyst provides more stabilization of transition states having pronounced charge-transfer character, which shifts the preference towards a stepwise mechanism.

Another alternative, explored in Paper IX, is to use an $\alpha$,$\beta$ -unsaturated ketone as a 'pro-diene', and let the enzyme generate the diene in situ by general acid/base catalysis. The results show that the potential reduction in the reaction barrier with such a mechanism is much larger than for conventional Diels-Alder. Moreover, an acid/base-mediated pathway is a better mimic of how natural enzymes function, since remarkably few catalyze their reactions solely by non-covalent interactions.},

The biological activity of organic nitrates can be said to be nitric oxide mimetic, leading to recent, exciting progress in realizing the therapeutic potential of nitrates. Unequivocally, nitroglycerine and most other organic nitrates, including NO-NSAIDs, do not behave as NO donors in the most fundamental action: in vitro activation of sGC to produce cGMP. The question as to whether the biological activity of nitrates results primarily or exclusively from NO donation will not be satisfactorily answered until the location, the apparatus, and the mechanism of reduction of nitrates to NO are defined. Similarly, the therapeutic potential of nitrates will not be unlocked until this knowledge is attained. Aspects of the therapeutic and biological activity of nitrates are reviewed in the context of the chemistry of nitrates and the elusive efficient 3e  reduction required to generate NO.},

abstract = {The thermal and kinetic aspects of gas phase decomposition reactions can be extremely complex due to a large number of parameters, a variety of possible intermediates, and an overlap in thermal decomposition traces. The experimental determination of the activation energies is particularly difficult when several possible reaction pathways coexist in the thermal decomposition. Ab initio calculations intended to provide an interpretation of the experiment are often of little help if they produce only the activation barriers and ignore the kinetics of the decomposition process. To overcome this ambiguity, a theoretical study of a complete picture of gas phase thermo-decomposition, including reaction energies, activation barriers, and reaction rates, is illustrated with the example of the $\beta$-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) molecule by means of quantum-chemical calculations.

abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

abstract = {Potential energy surfaces, minimum energy reaction paths, minima, transition states, reaction barriers, and conical intersections for the most important atmospheric reactions of methyl nitrate (CH3ONO2) and methylperoxy nitrite (CH3OONO) on the electronic ground state have been studied (i) with the second-order multiconfigurational perturbation theory (CASPT2) by computation of numerical energy gradients for stationary points and (ii) with the density functional theory (DFT). The proposed mechanism explains the conversion of unreactive alkyl peroxy radicals into alkoxy radicals:? CH3O2 + NO ? CH3OONO ? CH3O + NO2 ? CH3ONO2. Additionally, several discrepancies found in the comparison of the results obtained from the two employed approaches are analyzed. CASPT2 predicts that all dissociation reactions into radicals occur without an extra exit energy barrier. In contrast, DFT finds transition states for the dissociations of cis- and trans-methylperoxy nitrite into CH3O + NO2. Furthermore, multiconfigurational methods [CASPT2 and complete active space SCF (CAS-SCF)] predict the isomerization of CH3ONO2 to CH3OONO to occur in a two-step mechanism:? (i) CH3ONO2 ? CH3O + NO2; and (ii) CH3O + NO2 ? CH3OONO. The reason for this has to do with the coupling of the ground electronic state with the first excited state. Therefore, it is demonstrated that DFT methods based on single determinantal wave functions give an incorrect picture of the aforementioned reaction mechanisms.},

The decomposition kinetics of EHN and NC were determined by the Friedman isoconversional method. The kinetic parameters with heat balance were analysed and used for the simulation of the adiabatic behavior time to the maximum rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRad). The results indicated that the thermal history significantly influenced the dynamic DSC curves, decomposition kinetics and thermal stability of NC, which decomposes autocatalytically. The influence was negligible on EHN, whose decomposition proceeds according to the  nth order  law.},

abstract = {Different DFT methods give relative energies for models of the FeMo cluster in nitrogenase that differ by up to 600 kJ mol  1 . This is 4 30 times more than what is observed for other systems and explain why previous computational studies have given conflicting results. It is caused by differences in the oxidation state of the metals and the number of Fe C, Fe S and Fe H bonds, connected to the amount of static correlation. Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can cleave the triple bond in N 2 , making nitrogen avaiable for other organisms. It contains a complicated MoFe 7 S 9 C(homocitrate) cluster in its active site. Many computational studies with density-functional theory (DFT) of the nitrogenase enzyme have been presented, but they do not show any consensus   they do not even agree where the first four protons should be added, forming the central intermediate E 4 . We show that the prime reason for this is that different DFT methods give relative energies that differ by almost 600 kJ mol  1 for different protonation states. This is 4 30 times more than what is observed for other systems. The reason for this is that in some structures, the hydrogens bind to sulfide or carbide ions as protons, whereas in other structures they bind to the metals as hydride ions, changing the oxidation state of the metals, as well as the Fe C, Fe S and Fe Fe distances. The energies correlate with the amount of Hartree Fock exchange in the method, indicating a variation in the amount of static correlation in the structures. It is currently unclear which DFT method gives the best results for nitrogenase. We show that non-hybrid DFT functionals and TPSSh give the most accurate structures of the resting active site, whereas B3LYP and PBE0 give the best H 2 dissociation energies. However, no DFT method indicates that a structure of E 4 with two bridging hydride ions is lowest in energy, as spectroscopic experiments indicate.},

abstract = {The military currently has a large inventory of obsolete conventional munitions and waste propellants generated during the manufacturing pro:-ess. The current alternatives to storage are open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) and incineration to slowly reduce the inventory of these materials. The impact of OB/OD operations on the environment is under intense scrutiny by regulatory agencies and whpther or not they will be allowed to continue in their current form is unknown. Incineration is costly and does not utilize the energy content of the propellants. The United States Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency (USATHAMA) is currently conducting a program with Tennessee Valley Authority's National Fertilizer and Environmental Research Center to determine the feasibilit of utilizing propellants as supplemental fuels for the U.S. Army's industrial combustors. Disposing of obsolete and waste propellants in this manner could be both cost-effective and environmentally sound, and as an added benefit, would utilize the energy value of these materials.},

Tests were conducted to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics, as well as the chemical compatability, of nitrocellulose (NC) solvent No. 2 fuel oil solutions. Acetone, ethyl acetate, and butyl acetate were tested as solvents for NC. The results from these tests, coupled with an economic analysis, indicated that salvation of NC with the best solvent tested, acetone, and mixing with No. 2 fuel oil was not technically feasible or cost effective due to the low solubility of the NC. However, the economic analysis did indicate potential cost effectiveness using propellant No. 2 fuel oil slurries as supplemental fuels.},

abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from the high-NO x photooxidation of isoprene was dissolved in water and irradiated with l {\textgreater} 290 nm radiation to simulate direct photolytic processing of organics in atmospheric water droplets. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize the composition at four time intervals (0, 1, 2, and 4 h). Photolysis resulted in the decomposition of high molecular weight (MW) oligomers, reducing the average length of organics by 2 carbon units. The average molecular composition changed significantly after irradiation (C 12 H 19 O 9 N 0.08 + hn -C 10 H 16 O 8 N 0.40). Approximately 65{\%} by count of SOA molecules decomposed during photolysis, accompanied by the formation of new products. An average of 30{\%} of the organic mass was modified after 4 h of direct photolysis. In contrast, only a small fraction of the mass (o2{\%}), belonging primarily to organic nitrates, decomposed in the absence of irradiation by hydrolysis. Furthermore, the concentration of aromatic compounds increased significantly during photolysis. Approximately 10{\%} (lower limit) of photodegraded compounds and 50{\%} (upper limit) of the photoproducts contain nitrogen. Organic nitrates and multifunctional oligomers were identified as compounds degraded by photolysis. Low-MW 0N (compounds with 0 nitrogen atoms in their structure) and 2N compounds were the dominant photoproducts. Fragmentation experiments using tandem mass spectrometry (MS n , n = 2 3) indicate that the 2N products are likely heterocyclic/aromatic and are tentatively identified as furoxans. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, these 2N heterocyclic compounds are produced by reactions between photochemically-formed aqueous NO x species and SOA organics.},

The focus is comparison of computed and experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition, the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the 622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation are 3.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 kcal/mol for B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction.

abstract = {Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

For these two motives, one imagines that it would be very useful to understand a general method which may be able to serve to resolve directly a system of simultaneous equations.

Since the computation time for analytical energy gradients is approximately the same as for the energy, the optimization algorithm evaluates and utilizes the gradients each time the energy is computed. The second derivative matrix, rather than its inverse, is updated employing the gradients. At each step, a one dimensional minimization using a quartic polynomial is carried out, followed by an n dimensional search using the second derivative matrix. By suitably controlling the number of negative eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix, the algorithm can also be used to locate transition structures. Representative timing data for optimizations of equilibrium geometries and transition structures are reported for ab initio SCF MO calculations.},

abstract = {The energetics of the gas-phase SN2 reactions Y- + CH3X- f CH3Y + X- (where X,Y ) F,Cl,Br), were studied using (variants on) the recent W1 and W2 ab initio computational thermochemistry methods. These calculations involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of up to spdfgh quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and contributions of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic effects, and (where relevant) first-order spin-orbit coupling. Our computational predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental data where these have small error bars; in a number of other instances reexamination of the experimental data may be in order. Our computed benchmark data (including cases for which experimental data are unavailable altogether) are used to assess the quality of a number of compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2 theory, G3 theory, and CBS-QB3, as well as a variety of density functional theory methods. Upon applying some modifications to the level of theory used for the reference geometry (adding diffuse functions, replacing B3LYP by the very recently proposed mPW1K functional [Lynch, B. J.; Fast, P. L.; Harris, M.; Truhlar, D. G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 4811]), the compound methods appear to perform well. Only the  half-and-half  functionals BH{\&}HLYP and mPWH{\&}HPW91, and the empirical mPW1K functional, consistently find all required stationary points; the other functionals fail to find a transition state in the F/Br case. BH{\&}HLYP and mPWH{\&}HPW91 somewhat overcorrect for the tendency of B3LYP (and, to a somewhat lesser extent, mPW1PW91) to underestimate barrier heights. The Becke97 and Becke97-1 functionals perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study, while the HCTH and HCTH-120 functionals both appear to underestimate central barriers. HCTH underestimates complexation energies; this problem is resolved in HCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the functionals considered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound thermochemistry methods. mPW1K, however, appears to be very suitable for generating reference geometries for more elaborate thermochemical methods in kinetics applications.},

OBJECTIVE: Develop a composite propellant which has an extended plateau region in its burning rate vs. pressure relationship curve, as well as minimized variation in ballistic performance as a function of temperature change. DESCRIPTION: Double base (nitrocellulose {\&} nitroglycerine based) propellants widely used in Navy aircraft ejection seat systems experience degradation and depletion of the stabilizers used in the formulation over time with exposure to high operational and storage temperatures. This degradation results in safety risks due to the possibility of inadvertent spontaneous deflagration of the propellant. Current composite propellants typically do not have a pronounced plateau in their burning rate vs. pressure curves, and have a wider variation in performance with changes in temperature as compared to double base propellants. An innovative composite propellant to replace the current double based propellants used must be nitrate ester free and thermally stable across an operating temperature range from -65 degrees F to +200 degrees F. Ideally the propellant burning rate in the plateau region at ambient temperature would be approximately 1.0 inches per second at 2000 pounds per square inch (psi), followed by a negative slope in the burning rate curve, extending through at least 4500 to 5000 psi, and dropping by at least 0.4 inches per second. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Sigma sub p) would ideally be sp = 0.1 {\%}/ K or less. Such a composite propellant would have performance characteristics similar to a plateau burning double base propellant, currently in use in Naval ejection seat systems, but without the limited life inherent in propellants containing nitrate esters. This formulation would be developed and validated through adjustments to the propellant composition, followed by burning rate testing to demonstrate the effects of adjustments made. The burning rates of the final formulation supplied to the Navy will be measured at -65F, ambient temperature, and +200F across the pressure range of 500 to 5000 PSI. The formulation must contain ingredients which have been tested to demonstrate compatibility with each other. Mechanical properties testing, as well as basic propellant safety and characterization tests in accordance with NAVSEAINST 8020.5C are to be conducted, so a Department of Defense Interim Hazard Classification can be obtained for the propellant. The tests would be conducted on zero-time and propellant samples aged for 64 days at 200F, and the results supplied to the Navy. PHASE I: Determine the feasibility of the composite propellant developed in accordance with the identified parameters. PHASE II: Further develop and demonstrate through testing, a formulation which meets the performance objectives for burning rate and temperature sensitivity across the pressure range on zero-time and aged propellant samples. Characterization tests, scale up of the propellant manufacturing process, and manufacture of a quantity of propellant samples, one to two kilograms, for delivery to the Navy would also be performed in Phase II. PHASE III: Conduct the complete propellant characterization testing per NAVSEAINST 8020.5C and manufacture and transition a quantity of propellant samples for delivery to the Navy for testing. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: A composite propellant developed under this effort could be used in commercial mining, blasting, oil and gas exploration cartridge applications where consistent performance is required across a wide variation in temperature.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim This work aims to improve the computation of infrared spectra of gas-phase cations using DFT methods. Experimental infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra for ten Zn and Ru organometallic complexes have been used to provide reference data for 64 vibrational modes in the 900 2000 cm  1 range. The accuracy of the IR vibrational frequencies predicted for these bands has been assessed over five DFT functionals and three basis sets. The functionals include the popular B3LYP and M06-2X hybrids and the range-separated hybrids (RSH) CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP, and $\omega$B97X-D. B3LYP gives the best mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 7.1 and 9.6 cm  1 , whilst the best RSH functional, $\omega$B97X-D, gives 12.8 and 16.6 cm  1 , respectively. Using linear correlations instead of scaling factors improves the prediction accuracy significantly for all functionals. Experimental and computed spectra for a single complex can show significant differences even when the molecular structure is calculated correctly, and a means of defining confidence limits for any given computed structure is also provided.},

abstract = {Molecular level understanding of acid-catalysed conversion of sugar molecules to platform chemicals such as hydroxy-methyl furfural (HMF), furfuryl alcohol (FAL), and levulinic acid (LA) is essential for efficient biomass conversion. In this paper, the high-level G4MP2 method along with the SMD solvation model is employed to understand detailed reaction energetics of the acid-catalysed decomposition of glucose and fructose to HMF. Based on protonation free energies of various hydroxyl groups of the sugar molecule, the relative reactivity of gluco-pyranose, fructo-pyranose and fructo-furanose are predicted. Calculations suggest that, in addition to the protonated intermediates, a solvent assisted dehydration of one of the fructo-furanosyl intermediates is a competing mechanism, indicating the possibility of multiple reaction pathways for fructose to HMF conversion in aqueous acidic medium. Two reaction pathways were explored to understand the thermodynamics of glucose to HMF; the first one is initiated by the protonation of a C2-OH group and the second one through an enolate intermediate involving acyclic intermediates. Additionally, a pathway is proposed for the formation of furfuryl alcohol from glucose initiated by the protonation of a C2-OH position, which includes a C-C bond cleavage, and the formation of formic acid. The detailed free energy landscapes predicted in this study can be used as benchmarks for further exploring the sugar decomposition reactions, prediction of possible intermediates, and finally designing improved catalysts for biomass conversion chemistry in the future. ? 2012 the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {Although the thermal behaviors including thermal instability of nitrocellulose (NC) and its mixtures with some humectants have been comprehensively examined previously in the literature, their combustion characteristics have not been systematically studied. To address the issue, the combustion properties of NC with alcohol humectants are investigated by the means of the ISO 5660 cone calorimeter. Two kinds of NC-humectant mixtures with 30wt.{\%} isopropanol and 30wt.{\%} ethanol, respectively, were employed as samples. The tests were conducted under different external radiations, ranging from 0 15kW/m2. The experimental results indicate that the external radiation positively influences the peak heat release rate (HRR) intensity and the maximum mass loss rate (MLR), while the total heat release (THR) decreases with the elevated external radiation. Comparatively, the sample with isopropanol exhibits a higher fire risk, characterized by the higher peak HRR, THR and maximum MLR. Auxiliary investigating methods, including Scanning Electron Microscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimeter-Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, were applied to examine the micro structure and thermal behavior of NC-humectant mixtures. The results helped to explain the burning characteristics observed in the cone calorimeter tests.},

Most articles published in the past decade were designed: (1) to investigate polymeric parameters of nitrocellulose (e.g., molar mass distribution, viscosity and specific refractive index) by size-exclusion chromatography; (2) to determine the morphological and thermal characteristics of nitrocellulose using thermal and spectroscopic techniques; and, (3) to study the thermal, biological and mechanical degradation of nitrocellulose by thermal, spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric (MS) techniques, alone or coupled to gas chromatography. However, the few papers that focused on the determination of nitrocellulose used in explosives employed analytical techniques [e.g., vibrational techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy), MS and ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and liquid chromatography (LC) (high-performance LC and ion chromatography)]. Most of the information reported by these techniques has been qualitative.

Extruded materials also showed some evidence of the first-order transition as well as the commonly observed $\alpha$-relaxation.

The ordered arrangements of the molecules were observed with atomic resolution. The image of an arachidic acid molecule is composed of nineteen bright spots at the individual hydrocarbon groups in the alkyl chain and a dark region at the carboxyl group. The image of an elaidic acid molecule with an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain is similar to that of an arachidic acid molecule except for a much brighter spot at the double bond in the hydrocarbon chain. As a result, functional groups such as hydrocarbon chains, carboxyl groups and double bonds could be distinguished by the tunnel currents.},

abstract = {The book is a masterly treatise, reflecting the author's intimate knowledge of his subject. The manufacture and chemical, physical, and physiological properties of nitro compounds of interest in the technology of explosives are given detailed treatment. The explosives materials collection covered by this "cookbook" is not complete, of course. It will never be. It may anyway serve as a convenient guide for all occasional or professional users of explosives showing essentially what is available. Each one of the recipes is only a suggestion. It has been tried in this laboratory and it works, but it does not mean that a variation of the recipe does not work. In fact, the most of the recipes still permit substantial improvements. It may remain to the individual explosives materials chemist to work out such improvements. The book is well worth its relatively modest price and is recommended to all with interest in this interesting and actually little known area. This work touches on: *Nitric Esters - General Outline *Glycerol Trinitrate (Nitroglycerine) *Production of Nitroglycerine *Other Glycerine Esters *Glycol Esters *Monohydroxylic Alcohol Esters *Polyhydroxylic Alcohol Esters *Polyhydroxylic Branched-Chain and Cyclic Alcohol Esters *Cellulose and Nitrocellulose *General Characteristics of Nitrocellulose *Chemical Properties of Nitrocellulose *Nitration of Cellulose *Nitrocellulose Manufacture *Stabilization of Nitrocellulose *Manufacturing Special Types of Nitrocellulose *Nitric Esters of Polysaccharides Other Then Cellulose.

No growth was observed under the same conditions when carbon was absent. This would indicate that the organism utilized nitrogen fron nitrocellulose without attacking the carbon backbone. Further, mechanism studies indicated that the organism did not utilize the nitrogen directly from nitrocellulose, but rather relied on a hydrolysis reaction for a source of nitrogen.},

@techreport{Buelow2002,
abstract = {This effort was a survey of the compatibility of a broad series of representative energetic materials (EM) commonly used in propellants, munitions and explosives with a proposed process of controlled decomposition in water near or above the critical temperature (approximately 373  C). Central issues, in order of consideration, are safety, environmental compatibility of decomposition products, destruction efficiency, extrapolation to compounded formulations of EM, and engineering considerations for scale-up to full-scale operation. The sequence followed in these investigations was (1) initial safety evaluation and small-scale stability tests on each of 13 individual energetic ingredients commonly (all passed this stage); (2) determination of global kinetics and Destruction and Removal Efficiencies (DREs) (destruction was complete - all DREs are limited by sensitivity of detection); (3) identification of products and byproducts of the process to verify environmental compatibility (all tested passed this criterion); and (4) detailed reaction kinetics determinations and development of computational models (qualitatively successful application to nitromethane). An important result was the development of safe and practical means to deliver water-insoluble energetic materials (EM) into the supercritical region These methods included: 1) slurried particles, 2) dissolution in an organic solvent or supercritical carbon dioxide, and 3) digestion in aqueous alkali. A pilot- scale continuous pipe reactor suitable for handling slurried, dissolved, or hydrolyzed explosives was built and tested. Results show that supercritical water is a favorable medium for decomposition of waste and off-spec EM. The process appears to be controllable, and the decomposition products are contained until they are consciously released. Oxides of nitrogen do not form in significant amounts, presumably because the medium supports their decomposition at lower temperatures than does incineration. Digestion in aqueous alkali is a safe and economical pretreatment for most EM. Nickel alloy reactors can be used for formulations that contain only carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. Lined reactors are required for chlorine-containing mixtures and, in general, may be best of long term operation for all EM formulations. Useful detailed kinetic, fluid dynamic, and process modeling for SCW systems is not yet practical. Chemical reaction rates and physical properties data are needed for organic/ inorganic/water mixtures at high temperatures and pressures before models can quantitatively predict reactor operation.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis is a very important platform for the use of cellulose; however, the mechanism for the pyrolysis of cellulose is still not clear. A density functional theory (DFT) study was thus conducted to investigate the dehydration of cellulose using cellotriose as a model compound. The DFT study confirms that the location of hydroxyl groups has a significant influence on the dehydration of cellulose. The most active hydroxyl group is  O2H, followed by  O3H and  O6H. The pinacol rearrangement is a more likely mechanism for hydroxyl groups to be dehydrated. However, the barriers for dehydration are so high that dehydration reactions are difficult to occur. To obtain chemical products directly from the pyrolysis of cellulose, species with hydroxyl groups remaining might be targeted. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism of cellulose pyrolysis, especially on the breaking of the glycosidic linkage and the opening of pyran rings.},

abstract = {The crystal and molecular structure together with the hydrogen-bonding system in cellulose I? has been determined using synchrotron and neutron diffraction data recorded from oriented fibrous samples prepared by aligning cellulose microcrystals from tunicin. These samples diffracted both synchrotron X-rays and neutrons to better than 1 {\AA} resolution ({\textgreater}300 unique reflections; P21). The X-ray data were used to determine the C and O atom positions. The resulting structure consisted of two parallel chains having slightly different conformations and organized in sheets packed in a ?parallel-up? fashion, with all hydroxymethyl groups adopting the tg conformation. The positions of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding were determined from a Fourier-difference analysis using neutron diffraction data collected from hydrogenated and deuterated samples. The hydrogen atoms involved in the intramolecular O3{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O5 hydrogen bonds have well-defined positions, whereas those corresponding to O2 and O6 covered a wider volume, indicative of multiple geometry with partial occupation. The observation of this disorder substantiates a recent infrared analysis and indicates that, despite their high crystallinity, crystals of cellulose I? have an inherent disorganization of the intermolecular H-bond network that maintains the cellulose chains in sheets.

The X-ray data were used to determine the C and O atom positions. The resulting structure is a one-chain triclinic unit cell with all glucosyl linkages and hydroxymethyl groups (tg) identical. However, adjacent sugar rings alternate in conformation giving the chain a cellobiosyl repeat. The chains organize in sheets packed in a "parallel-up" fashion.

While high-resolution crystallographic data have established a solid basis for computational analysis of cellulose, previous work has demonstrated a tendency for modeled microfibrils to diverge from the linear experimental structure and adopt a twisted conformation. Here, we investigate the dependence of this twisting behavior on computational approximations and establish the theoretical basis for its occurrence. We examine the role of solvent, the effect of nonbonded force field parameters [partial charges and van der Waals (vdW) contributions], and the use of explicitly modeled oxygen lone pairs in both the solute and solvent. Findings suggest that microfibril twisting is favored by vdW interactions, and counteracted by both intrachain hydrogen bonds and solvent effects at the microfibril surface.},

abstract = {The industrial application of nitrocellulose depends on its nitrogen content. When nitrocellulose presents high nitrogen content is used in the manufacture of explosives whereas nitrocellulose with low nitrogen content is used to make a wide range of daily and non-explosive products (e.g. cigarettes, paints, lacquers). This fact makes really important to develop a method for the determination and discrimination of nitrocellulose samples. This work reports, for the first time, the qualitative determination of nitrocellulose previously derivatized with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS) by capillary electrophoresis (CE-LIF) with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF). APTS-labeled nitrocellulose was determined in lowly and highly nitrated nitrocellulose samples present in collodions and smokeless gunpowders, respectively, after their pulverization in liquid nitrogen. The method described enables the visual discrimination of different nitrocelluloses on the basis of the different electrophoretic profiles obtained, and provides a useful tool to determine nitrocellulose. Additionally, the use of field-amplified sample injection (FASI) enabled enhanced sample detection, which made it possible to determine nitrocellulose contained in  15. $\mu$g of gunpowder. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work, a new approach for the isolation of nitrocellulose from smokeless gunpowders has been developed. A multistep solvent extraction method was needed to purify nitrocellulose contained in gunpowders. For single-base or double-base gunpowders six consecutive solvent extractions were selected: three extractions with methanol (to remove nitroglycerin, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, ethyl-centralite, diphenylamine, and diphenylamine derivatives); one extraction with dichloromethane (to remove colorants and plasticizers of organic nature); one extraction with methanol (to facilitate a final polar extraction); and one extraction with water (to remove ionic components) were necessary at 35 degrees C. For the triple-base gunpowder studied, eight solvent extractions were needed due to a high concentration of the water-soluble nitroguanidine was present. In addition to the same five initial phases used for the single-base and double-base gunpowders, three water extraction phases at a higher temperature (75 degrees C instead of 35 degrees C) were also needed. A final step to solubilize nitrocellulose in methyl ethyl ketone was used to remove inert components (mainly graphite). Nitrocellulose isolated from these propellants was characterized by Fourier-Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR spectroscopy). The same FTIR spectra were observed for nitrocelluloses isolated from different types of gunpowders. A comparison of FTIR spectra of nitrocellulose samples of different nitration degree evidenced that the bands regions most affected by this factor were: 3600-3400cm(-1), corresponding to the stretching vibrations of residual hydroxyl groups; 1200-1000cm(-1), attributed to the valence vibrations nuCO of the glucopyranose cycle; and 750-690cm(-1), assigned to vibrations of the nitrate group. In both cases, the bands appearing in these regions were more pronounced in the spectra of nitrocellulose samples of low nitration degree.},

abstract = {Data on the thermal stability of energetic materials such as nitrocellulose was required in order to obtain safety information for handling, storage and use. In the present study, the thermal stability of four nitrocellulose samples containing various amount of nitrate groups was determined by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetery-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the nitrocellulose occurs in the temperature ranges of 192-209 degrees C. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of compounds indicates that nitrate content of nitrocellulose could has affect on its thermal stability and its decomposition temperature decrease by increasing its nitrogen percent. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C/min) on the DSC behaviour of the nitrocellulose was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperature of the compound was increased. Also, the kinetic parameters such as activation energy and frequency factor for the compound was obtained from the DSC data by non-isothermal methods proposed by ASTM E696 and Ozawa.},

abstract = {A non-destructive UV Vis spectroscopic method to study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During the aging of the NC two secondary and one primary CO NO2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C2, C3 and C6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV Vis spectra of the dye and its nitrated derivatives. The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the  ln(AS(0)/AS(t)) vs aging time' plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40  C, 50  C, 60  C and 70  C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO NO2 groups at the C2, C3 and C6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily with each other and with quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO NO2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO NO2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO NO2 groups was concluded to be C6 {\textgreater} C2 {\textgreater} C3.},

The dye acts as a stabilizer and is slowly depleted as a result of its reaction with NOx from the breakdown of the nitrate ester groups on NC. The data produced two linear regions in the first-order plots of ln(A0/At) vs aging time. The first-region is attributed to the reaction of the dye with NOx desorbed from the NC surface.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of cellulose have recently become more prevalent due to increased interest in renewable energy applications, and many atomistic and coarse-grained force fields exist that can be applied to cellulose. However, to date no systematic comparison between carbohydrate force fields has been conducted for this important system. To that end, we present a molecular dynamics simulation study of hydrated, 36-chain cellulose I? microfibrils at room temperature with three carbohydrate force fields (CHARMM35, GLYCAM06, and Gromos 45a4) up to the near-microsecond time scale. Our results indicate that each of these simulated microfibrils diverge from the cellulose I? crystal structure to varying degrees under the conditions tested. The CHARMM35 and GLYCAM06 force fields eventually result in structures similar to those observed at 500 K with the same force fields, which are consistent with the experimentally observed high-temperature behavior of cellulose I. The third force field, Gromos 45a4, produces behavior significantly different from experiment, from the other two force fields, and from previously reported simulations with this force field using shorter simulation times and constrained periodic boundary conditions. For the GLYCAM06 force field, initial hydrogen-bond conformations and choice of electrostatic scaling factors significantly affect the rate of structural divergence. Our results suggest dramatically different time scales for convergence of properties of interest, which is important in the design of computational studies and comparisons to experimental data. This study highlights that further experimental and theoretical work is required to understand the structure of small diameter cellulose microfibrils typical of plant cellulose. Molecular dynamics simulations of cellulose have recently become more prevalent due to increased interest in renewable energy applications, and many atomistic and coarse-grained force fields exist that can be applied to cellulose. However, to date no systematic comparison between carbohydrate force fields has been conducted for this important system. To that end, we present a molecular dynamics simulation study of hydrated, 36-chain cellulose I? microfibrils at room temperature with three carbohydrate force fields (CHARMM35, GLYCAM06, and Gromos 45a4) up to the near-microsecond time scale. Our results indicate that each of these simulated microfibrils diverge from the cellulose I? crystal structure to varying degrees under the conditions tested. The CHARMM35 and GLYCAM06 force fields eventually result in structures similar to those observed at 500 K with the same force fields, which are consistent with the experimentally observed high-temperature behavior of cellulose I. The third force field, Gromos 45a4, produces behavior significantly different from experiment, from the other two force fields, and from previously reported simulations with this force field using shorter simulation times and constrained periodic boundary conditions. For the GLYCAM06 force field, initial hydrogen-bond conformations and choice of electrostatic scaling factors significantly affect the rate of structural divergence. Our results suggest dramatically different time scales for convergence of properties of interest, which is important in the design of computational studies and comparisons to experimental data. This study highlights that further experimental and theoretical work is required to understand the structure of small diameter cellulose microfibrils typical of plant cellulose.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose (NC) aerogel was prepared by sol-gel synthetic approach and supercritical carbon dioxide drying method as a new energetic matrix for nano-composite energetic materials. Scanning electron microscopy of the NC aerogel reveals that the aerogel is accumulated by nanoparticles with a diameter of 30-50 nm and has nano-porous structure, which makes the thermal behavior of the NC aerogel different from that of the NC fibers. Therefore, the thermal properties of NC aerogel were determined by TG/DSC, which showed that the maximum decomposition temperature and the exothermic peak temperature of NC aerogel decreased 8.2 and 11.4 degrees C than NC fibers, respectively. By TG/FTIR technology combined FTIR test of the condensed phase, the decomposition mechanism was derived based on the experimental results. The initial reaction of NC aerogel decomposition is the splitting of urethane bond, and then, the scission of -O-NO2 bonds happens. Moreover, the macromolecular chains' scission site of NC aerogel firstly occurs at -C-O-C- in the ring, while the chains of NC fibers break at -C-O-C- between the rings.},

abstract = {Nitrocellulose based (NC) and nitroglycerin based (NG) propellants often have a fixed acid and water content during the manufacturing time. After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a a complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a it complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters. Correlation between heat flow curve, stabilizer depletion and free-radical distribution has been evaluated. An intramolecular decomposition mechanism is preferred, because it prevents the possibility that the NOx from NNODPA or NNDPA may interact with the NC and NG again during the rearrangement process. Since the acidity of the propellant composition continues to change during the aging process, multiple mechanisms may proceed simultaneously.},

However, it is considered as one of the primary pollutants in the energetic material industries because it can be degraded to form polluting chemical species. In this work, the UV light degradation of cellulose nitrate films was studied under conditions of artificially accelerated photooxidation. To eliminate the reactivity of nitro groups, the degradation of ethylcellulose was also investigated. Infrared spectroscopy analyses of the chemical modifications caused by the photooxidation of cellulose nitrate films and the resulting formation of volatile products revealed the occurrence of de-nitration and the formation of oxidation photoproducts exhibiting lactone and anhydride functions. The impact of these chemical modifications on the mechanical and thermal properties of cellulose nitrate films includes embrittlement and lower temperatures of ignition when used as a propellant. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Standard quantum chemical methods are used for accurate calculation of thermochemical properties such as enthalpies of formation, entropies and Gibbs energies of formation. Equilibrium reactions are widely investigated and experimental measurements often lead to a range of reaction Gibbs energies and equilibrium constants. It is useful to calculate these equilibrium properties from quantum chemical methods in order to address the experimental differences. Furthermore, most standard calculation methods differ in accuracy and feasibility of the system size. Hence, a systematic comparison of equilibrium properties calculated with different numerical algorithms would provide a useful reference. We select two well-known gas phase equilibrium reactions with small molecules: covalent dimer formation of NO2 (2NO2 {\^{a}} {\OE} N2O4) and the synthesis of NH 3 (N2 + 3 H2 {\^{a}} {\OE} 2NH 3). We test four quantum chemical methods denoted by G3B3, CBS-APNO, W1 and CCSD(T) with aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets (X = 2, 3, and 4), to obtain thermochemical data for NO2, N2O4, and NH 3. The calculated standard formation Gibbs energies $\Delta$fG are used to calculate standard reaction Gibbs energies $\Delta$rG and standard equilibrium constants Keq for the two reactions. Standard formation enthalpies $\Delta$fH are calculated in a more reliable way using high-level methods such as W1 and CCSD(T). Standard entropies S for the molecules are calculated well within the range of experiments for all methods, however, the values of standard formation Gibbs energies $\Delta$fG show some dependence on the choice of the method. High-level methods perform better for the calculation of molecular energies, however, simpler methods such as G3B3 and CBS-APNO perform quite well in the calculation of total reaction energies and equilibrium constants, provided that the chemical species involved do not exhibit molecular geometries that are difficult to handle by the applied method. The temperature dependence of standard reaction Gibbs energy $\Delta$rG for the NH3 reaction is discussed by using the calculated standard formation Gibbs energies $\Delta$fG of the reaction species at 298.15 K. The corresponding equilibrium constant Keq as a function of temperature is found to be close to experimental values. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Demilitarisation is an increasingly important aspect of munitions management. With a drive for higher performance and greater safety, new munitions and fillings render old munitions obsolete and munitions stockpiles cost money both to establish and maintain so surplus munitions are an unwelcome expense and potentially a risk. The process of disposal is being shaped by a number of factors. Foremost is increasingly stringent environmental regulation restricting and modifying the methods. But other factors are also significant such as transhipment regulation, restrictions on proliferation of conventional weapons, and resource recovery either through financial pressure or policy. The result is a menagerie of demilitarisation techniques   sometimes complementary, sometimes competing   that this paper provides an overview of. All munitions have a finite service life and will at some stage need to be either expended or disposed of. Disposal can involve dumping, resale and demilitarisation. Dumping is banned at sea as a result of the London Convention and related agreements. Dumping on land is severely restricted if not banned in most jurisdictions. Resale is an attractive option in terms of recovering value from munitions however munitions must be serviceable to resell and this option is restricted by issues of proliferation and security. This leaves demilitarisation as the primary method of disposal. Demilitarisation means removing or otherwise neutralising the military potential of an item, in this case a munition. This may or may not involve the destruction of the munition but it does require that the energetic material is destroyed or converted. 1.1},

abstract = {Due to demilitarization activities in the United States, large amounts of energetic materials which have been accumulated over the years in various manufacturing and military installations, have to be dealt with in an environmentally acceptable manner. Historically, the method of choice for destruction of energetic materials has been open burning or open detonation which are neither safe nor environmentally desirable. Alkaline hydrolysis appears to be a simple, inexpensive method for breaking explosives and propellants down to non-energetic materials that can be directly disposed or further treated biologically. Nitrocellulose is one of the energetic materials classified as reactive (40 CFR 261.21) and is listed under the Resource Conservation {\&} Recovery Act (RCRA). This RCRA classification designates energetic materials as a hazardous waste. This study focused on the kinetics of decomposition of nitrocellulose using sodium hydroxide at different dosage levels, temperature, and contact times. Significant levels of denitration and breakdown of the backbone of cellulose structure were achieved by this method. The post-digestion products consist of organic and inorganic substances with sodium nitrite and nitrate being the major nitrogen containing compounds. The ratio of nitrite-N to nitrate-N is slightly changed at different sodium hydroxide concentrations but it approaches a value of 3 regardless of the degree of digestion. The time required for complete destruction varies with concentration of sodium hydroxide and temperature. Kinetic modeling showed that the process follows a pseudo-first-order rate law. The present work indicates that alkaline digestion may be the technology of choice for the destruction of nitrocellulose in various gun and rocket propellants, and for the treatment of nitrocellulose laden effluents from munitions manufacturing facilities.},

abstract = {Various nitrocellulose (NC) manufacturing processes at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (PAAP), VA produce wastewater containing NC particles in millimeter, micron, and sub-micron range, known as 'fines.' Available NC fines characterization data vary widely and often conflict with each other because they are based on 'grab samples,' in which the wastewater quality can fluctuate widely. A critical need exists to collect and analyze NC fines characteristics at each sequence for each unit operation over an extended period of time. The U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL) has been evaluating technical alternatives and developing technologies to separate, recycle, and treat NC fines from RAAP manufacturing wastewater. This study characterized the physical properties of NC fines and developed a strategy to prevent pollution with NC fines. Characterized parameters included particle size distribution (PSD), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, zeta potential (particle surface charge), conductivity, and pH. Recommended pollution prevention methods included separation and recycle of NC fines at each process, more effective settling, and in-process modifications.},

abstract = {Proton transfer reactions play a key role in the conversion of biomass derived sugars to chemicals. In this study, we employ high level ab initio theoretical methods, in tandem with solvation effects to calculate the proton affinities (PA) and acidity constants (pKa) of various d-glucose and d-fructose tautomers (protonation-deprotonation processes). In addition, we compare the theoretically derived pH values of sugar solutions against experimentally measured pH values in our lab. Our results demonstrate that the protonation of any of the O atoms of the sugars is thermodynamically preferred without any significant variation in the PA values. Intramolecular hydrogen transfers, dehydration reactions, and ring-opening processes were observed, resulting from the protonation of specific hydroxyl groups on the sugars. Regarding the deprotonation processes (pKa), we found that the sugars' anomeric hydroxyls exhibit the highest acidity. The theoretically calculated pH values of sugar solutions are in excellent agreement with experimental pH measurements at low sugar concentrations. At higher sugar concentrations the calculations predict less acidic solutions than the experiments. In this case, we expect the sugars to act as solvents increasing the proton solvation energy and the acidity of the solutions. We demonstrated through linear relationships that the pKa values are correlated with the relative stability of the conjugate bases. The latter is related to hydrogen bonding and polarization of the C-O(-) bond. A plausible explanation for the good performance of the direct method in calculating the pKa values of sugars can be the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the conjugate base. Both theory and experiments manifest that fructose is a stronger acid than glucose, which is of significant importance in self-catalyzed biomass-relevant dehydration reactions.},

Effect of the bulk water solution was modeled using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach. It has been suggested that the dimeric form of 2,3,6-trinitro-$\beta$-d-glucopyranose can be considered as the smallest model to study the nitrocellulose system regarding the alkaline hydrolysis reaction. It was predicted that the peeling-off reaction will start after the denitration of various sites, which will follow a C3   C6   C2 denitration route. Further, it was determined that the peeling-off reaction will be more preferred than the ring cleavage through the ring CO bond.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature B.V. The thermal behavior of nitrocellulose (NC) with different nitrogen contents has been widely investigated in previous works. However, most of the experiments were carried out under high heating rates, a situation in which it is difficult to capture minor changes during the thermal decomposition process. In the present study, the thermal characteristics of NC with different nitrogen contents were theoretically and experimentally investigated using a CALVET heat flux calorimeter C80 at heating rates from 0.2 to 0.8  C/min. Before thermal analysis, the results of high-precision scanning electron microscopy showed that more cracks and coarser surfaces were detected on NC fibers with higher nitrogen contents. It was found that a  turning point  was detected on the heat flow curves of NC with higher nitrogen contents. Furthermore, the heat flow curves of NC transformed from  bell shape  to  right triangles  with increases in the nitrogen content, which suggested that NC with high nitrogen contents exhibited autocatalysis characteristics under low heating rates. This characteristic was also confirmed by the isothermal experiment results that showed the autocatalytic properties became increasingly obvious by increasing the isothermal temperature. Moreover, the relevant chemical kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were obtained. The heat of the reaction ($\Delta$H) increased and the activation energy values in the initial stages of NC decomposition decreased as the nitrogen content was increased. Furthermore, the critical explosion temperature (T b ), which is as an important parameter to evaluate the thermal hazard of NC, decreased by elevating the nitrogen content.},

@article{Foltz2009,
abstract = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a relatively sensitive explosive used in many electroexplosive devices as well as in medicine. Of primary interest to LLNL is its use in items such as exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators and exploding bridge foil initiators (EFI). In these devices the crystalline powder is pressed into a granular, low-density compact that can be initiated by an exploding wire or foil. The long-term stability of this pressed compact is of interest to weapon stockpile lifetime prediction studies. Key points about potential aging mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1) There are a number of factors that can contribute to PETN instability. These include particle size, polymorphic phase transitions, crystal structure, impurities, moisture, occlusions, chemical incompatibility and biological (microorganism) action. of these factors the most important for long-term aging of high surface area powders used in detonators appears to be that of particle size growth. (2) There is a great deal of literature on the thermal degradation kinetics of PETN, unfortunately much of it with little bearing on ambient temperature aging during long-term storage. PETN is very stable with respect to thermal decomposition. Low-temperature thermal studies have not revealed evidence of chemical degradation products in archived PETN. Data extrapolated to 30 C predicts a half-life of 12 million years. (3) Moisture seems to lower the activation energy for and accelerate the decomposition of PETN. (4) External drivers affecting stability include temperature, moisture, radiation fields, and stress, while internal drivers include residual solvents, and impurities. Temperature affects kinetic processes of crystal growth such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion rates of molecules on the surface of PETN crystals. A low-level radiation field may induce unexpected changes in the chemical makeup of PETN and its homologue impurities. Stress at high pressure points caused by crystalline surface irregularities may cause a decrease in surface area over time due to smoothing of contact points and sintering. PETN has been found to contain a number of impurities, including homologues, pentaerythryl ethers with a mixture of hydroxyl and nitrate functional groups, and organic salts, that can alter its physical and chemical properties. (5) The processes of sublimation/recrystallization and surface diffusion are important processes that can cause changes in PETN crystal morphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area. Sublimation feeds a process called Ostwald ripening, which involves the spontaneous growth of larger crystals from those of smaller size. This process proceeds with age regardless of storage conditions unless the crystals are treated to retard growth. The coarsening mechanisms include Ostwald ripening, 'sintering', and surface diffusion. The latter has not been experimentally observed, but a molecular modeling approach has attempted to investigate this phenomenon theoretically. (6) Threshold test fire, particle size distribution, specific surface area, thermal analysis, chemical analysis, powder compact specific surface area and density are approaches that have been used in the attempt to assess changes attributable to aging of PETN, with varying results. The biggest problem lies in the aging mechanism itself, which likely influences small changes in morphology, both internal and external, and particle size distribution changes on a scale too small to reliably monitor. Other aspects, such as subtle changes in density profiles within pressed powder compacts, may be beyond the capability of current technology to assess. Crystal growth significant enough to affect the PETN particle size distribution is expected to impact detonator performance. (7) Factors relevant to stabilizing particle size growth include crystal morphology, powder surface area and particle size distribution; crystal density and internal defects; and powder compact density and density gradients.},

The formulation of PETN into XTX8003 (80{\%} PETN, 20{\%} Sylgard 182) creates an extrudable energetic composite. PETN and XTX8003 are used in the firesets for the retired W68 (MC2370) and the W76 (MC3028). When faced with potential lifetime extensions, energetic materials are naturally suspect regarding their output after prolonged aging. The authors have studied PETN and XTX8003 by looking at 25-year-old samples from retired MC2370s and newer materials. Both the old and new materials have also been placed in various accelerated aging protocols to investigate any decomposition that might occur over time. PETN is known to decompose autocatalytically even in the early stages of decomposition, but the process is poorly understood. Published values for the activation energy of decomposition vary by {\textgreater}40 kcal/mol. The 12 million year half life predicted for room temperature PETN would be dramatically shortened by chemical influences that lead to lower energy decomposition pathways. Degree of confinement, purity, and crystal size all influence degradation rates. In this paper, the authors observe the effects of chemical and thermal aging on PETN. They anticipate changes in mechanism at higher temperature aging, and before trying to extrapolate to lower temperatures, they want to make sure that they understand the different chemical processed involved.},

abstract = {The manufacturing process for solventless extruded double base propellants involves a number of rolling and reworking stages. Throughout these processes a decrease in weight average molecular weight was observed, this was attributed to denitration. Differential scanning calorimetery data indicated that the reworking stages of extruded double base propellant manufacture were crucial to the homogenisation of the propellant mixture. To determine the homogeneity of the final extruded product, a sample was analysed across its diameter. No variations in stabiliser concentration, molecular weight, or Vickers hardness were detected. An accelerated thermal ageing trial simulating up to 8 years of ageing at 25 C was carried out to evaluate the storage characteristics. Reductions in stabiliser concentration, number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight and polydispersity compared with un-aged samples were observed. The glass transition temperature measured using differential scanning calorimetery decreased by {\~{}}3 C. The decrease was attributed to the initial denitration reducing the energy of bond rotation and shortening the polymer chains, both factors reducing the energy required for movement. Modulus values determined from dynamic mechanical analysis temperature scanning experiments, did not detect significant variation between un-aged and aged samples. Though it was considered that variations would be likely if a more extensive ageing program was completed. In order to evaluate propellant behaviour at very high and low frequencies, time temperature superposition (TTS) and creep testing were carried out. The TTS technique superpositioned data well, allowing future investigation of high frequency propellant properties. Creep testing was considered to be an appropriate approach, though the equipment available was not optimised for such testing. This thesis is concerned with understanding how propellants are manufactured from nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine and other constituents. It is also about how the propellants decompose during long periods of time in storage, and how these changes can be measured using thermal and mechanical methods. It is about how the physical, chemical and thermal properties of the propellant composition change throughout the manufacture. This is relevant as it could be used to develop more efficient manufacturing processes, allow operators to adjust processes to tailor product properties or be used to re-design manufacturing to compensate for a different starting material. The thesis also considers how and why the properties of the product change over the course of years of storage. A specific focus on whether changes in mechanical and thermal properties occur, and if so how they can be detected.},

abstract = {All-cellulose nanocomposite (ACNC) film was produced from sugarcane bagasse nanofibers using N,N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride solvent. The average diameter of bagasse fibers (14 $\mu$m) was downsized to 39 nm after disk grinding process. X-ray diffraction showed that apparent crystallinity and crystallite size decreased relatively to an increased duration of dissolution time. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that thermal stability of the ACNC was slightly less than that of the pure cellulose nanofiber sheet. Tensile strength of the fiber sheet, nanofiber sheet and ACNC prepared with 10 min dissolution time were 8, 101 and 140 MPa, respectively. Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the ACNC film increased relatively to an increased duration of dissolution time. ACNC can be considered as a multi-performance material with potential for application in cellulose-based food packaging owing to its promising properties (tough, bio-based, biodegradable and acceptable levels of WVP). {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Zare2018,
abstract = {Abstract. Organic nitrate chemistry is the primary control over the lifetime of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in rural and remote continental locations. As NOx emissions decrease, organic nitrate chemistry becomes increasingly important to urban air quality. However, the lifetime of individual organic nitrates and the reactions that lead to their production and removal remain relatively poorly constrained, causing organic nitrates to be poorly represented by models. Guided by recent laboratory and field studies, we developed a detailed gas phase chemical mechanism representing most of the important individual organic nitrates. We use this mechanism within the WRF-Chem model to describe the role of organic nitrates in nitrogen oxide chemistry and in comparisons to observations. We find the daytime lifetime of total organic nitrates with respect to all loss mechanisms to be 2.6h in the model. This is consistent with analyses of observations at a rural site in central Alabama during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in summer 2013. The lifetime of the first-generation organic nitrates is {\~{}}2h versus the 3.2h lifetime of secondary nitrates produced by oxidation of the first-generation nitrates. The different generations are subject to different losses, with dry deposition to the surface dominant loss process for the second-generation organic nitrates, and chemical loss dominant for the first-generation organic nitrates. Removal by hydrolysis is found to be responsible for the loss of {\~{}}30{\%} of the total organic nitrate pool.},

abstract = {The isodesmic reaction method is applied to calculate the potential energy surface (PES) along the reaction coordinates and the rate constants of the barrierless reactions for unimolecular dissociation reactions of alkanes to form two alkyl radicals and their reverse recombination reactions. The reaction class is divided into 10 subclasses depending upon the type of carbon atoms in the reaction centers. A correction scheme based on isodesmic reaction theory is proposed to correct the PESs at UB3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level. To validate the accuracy of this scheme, a comparison of the PESs at B3LYP level and the corrected PESs with the PESs at CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ level is performed for 13 representative reactions, and it is found that the deviations of the PESs at B3LYP level are up to 35.18 kcal/mol and are reduced to within 2 kcal/mol after correction, indicating that the PESs for barrierless reactions in a subclass can be calculated meaningfully accurately at a low level of ab initio method using our correction...},

abstract = {Protonations of alpha- and beta-D-glucopyranose in the gas phase were investigated using the ab initio molecular orbital approach at the HF/6-31G* level with full geometry optimization. Minimum-energy structures of three neutral and six protonated species for each anomer were calculated, Geometries, energies, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these structures are discussed. For the neutral species at 298 K the order of stability for the hydroxymethyl conformers is calculated to be GT {\textgreater} CG {\textgreater} TG for the a anomer and GG {\textgreater} CT {\textgreater} TG fur the beta anomer. Protonated species that least disrupt the internal hydrogen bonding network in the neutral species are considered: these include protonations on the oxygen sites labeled as the hydroxymethyl O6, the ring O5, and the exocylic hydroxyl O4. The O6 protonation in the TG conformation is electronically most favored. Energy corrections fur basis-set deficiency and electron-correlation omission in the adopted theoretical procedure were estimated from high-level calculations on ethanol, 2-propanol, and dimethyl ether. In addition, the gas-phase basicity (GB) of glucose was measured by proton transfer reactions in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The experimental GB values for both anomers were determined to be 188 +/- 3 kcal/mol. The experimental values are compared with the ab initio estimates of 178-190 and 177-189 kcal/mol for the respective alpha and beta anomers. Theoretical structures for the lowest-electronic-energy protonated species in the three hydroxymethyl conformations of each anomer are also presented to serve as reference data for postulating various kinetic pathways.

@article{Hu2011,
abstract = {Abstract. The presence of alcohol, organonitrate, and organosulfate species related to the gaseous precursor isoprene in ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has stimulated investigations of the nature of SOA-phase chemical processing. Recent work has suggested that certain isoprene-derived organonitrates are able to efficiently convert to organosulfates and alcohols on ambient SOA. In order to better understand the structure activity relationships previously observed for the isoprene-derived organonitrates and organosulfates, the hydrolysis reactions of a number of monofunctional and difunctional organonitrates and organosulfates with varying carbon substitution properties were investigated. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to study the bulk phase aqueous reactions of these organonitrates and organosulfates in order to determine hydrolysis reaction rate and, in some cases, thermodynamics information. Electronic structure calculations were also carried out to determine the enthalpy of hydrolysis for these species, and for the previously studied isoprene-derived species. The results suggest that while organonitrates and organosulfates are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the corresponding alcohols at standard state, only the tertiary organonitrates (and perhaps some tertiary organosulfates) are able to efficiently hydrolyze on SOA timescales and acidities.},

abstract = {Well-characterized, purified samples of glycidyl azide polymer (MW 700) having one, two, or three terminal -OH groups were flash pyrolyzed (dT/dt = 800 K/s) to 540 600 K under 2 atm Ar by T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy. This technique emphasizes condensed-phase pyrolysis chemistry as opposed to gas-phase flame chemistry. The volatile products identified from the condensed phase were CH4, HCN, CO, C2H4, NH3, CH2O, CH2CO, H2O, and GAP oligomers. IR-inactive N2 is, of course, also present. The low MW products result from homolysis of the heavy atom bonds and H-atom migration, as opposed to heavy atom recombination reactions. After N2 release, the relations between the mole fractions of the products and the parent GAP structure were determined. The NH3 content increases with the -OH content, which suggests that NH3 is mostly formed by the end-chain azide groups. The hydrocarbon mole fractions correlate with the structure of the parent sample of GAP. CO appears to form from both the parent polymer and secondary sources, such as CH2O and CH2CO, at higher temperature. The HCN/NH3 ratio increases with increasing temperature. By using the product mole fractions and heat of formation of GAP, the calculated heat of decomposition ( 1.4 kcal/g) is found to be three times larger than that measured by DSC ( 0.43 kcal/g). The large $\Delta$Hd helps explain the reported high surface temperature. The relatively low reported flame temperature during combustion reflects the limited number of secondary exothermic reactions that are possible among the products. If it occurs during combustion, the apparent release of some GAP oligomers observed during flash pyrolysis would raise the flame temperature by allowing the decomposition of some of the GAP in the gas phase. The kinetics of formation of NH3 [Ea = 49 kcal/mol, In(A/s) = 42] were determined below the autothermal stage. Above the autothermal stage, the products form at too rapid a rate to be measured by the methods used.},
