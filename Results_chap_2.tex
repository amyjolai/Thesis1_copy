\section{Introduction}

\section{Computational details}
%Programme, method (e.g. functional/ FF), settings(basis sets, thermostats, ensembles etc)

%Include further calculation details - such as transition state theory etc, in another subsection (e.g. Transtion state theory) under this header.

All chemical species underwent an initial \ac{QM} geometry optimisation to the level of $\omega$B97X-D / 6-31G(2df,p) and except where otherwise stated, were performed in Gaussian 09 D.01 (REF). %[REMEMBER TO INCLUDE ANY NMR AND FREQ OPTIONS I USED]
