\subsection{Thermolytic reactions}

The first stage of thermolytic decomposition for nitrate esters is generally agreed to be homolytic fission of the O-N bond linking the nitrate to the alkyl chain, leading to the loss of \rad\ce{NO2} (equation \ref{equ:homofiss}) \cite{Oxley2003,Foltz2009,Shepodd1997}. %many refs
Though nitrate homolysis is an endothermic reaction, the weak O-N bond has a typical dissociation enthalpy of 42 kcal mol\textsuperscript{-1} and is easily cleaved when exposed to elevated temperatures, UV light or impact \cite{Zaki2017}. %REF UV 
Whilst the thermolytic degradation of energetic materials has been widely studied experimentally, the ambient, slow ageing mechanisms are less well documented. %REF
Low-temperature decomposition routes are influenced by many factors over a protracted lifetime, and in practical use, materials are usually subject to evolving environmental conditions. %Changes in pressure, humidity, stress and temperature cycles induce changes in the degradation patterns of energetic materials to a varying degree. %ref?
External changes in pressure, humidity, stress and temperature cycling introduce variation in the degradation patterns of energetic materials. %ref?
%The array of products produced as a result of slow ageing may therefore vary greatly from those obtained from thermolysis; a general observation is that the number of different species is far smaller. %REF
The presence of moisture has been observed to lower the activation energy and accelerate decomposition %of energetic materials 
\cite{Foltz2009}.  %PETN
Internal factors including impurities, residual solvent, and crystal growth within the bulk, also alter decomposition behaviour.

%
The degradation of nitrate esters at temperatures over 100$\degree$C is primarily \textit{via} thermolytic processes, whilst under 100$\degree$C, decomposition is largely thought to be the result of hydrolysis \cite{Moniruzzaman2014}. 
Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.} studied the intramolecular reactions leading to denitration in \acf{PETN} in both the vacuum and the bulk crystal \cite{Tsyshevsky2013} (figure \ref{fig:PETN_react}). 
%
Seven mechanisms for the removal of \ce{NO2} were explored. Corresponding to the labels in figure \ref{fig:PETN_react}:
(1) homolytic cleavage of the \ce{O-NO2} bond, (2) the elimination of nitrous acid (\ce{HNO2}) which is usually considered a competing reaction to homolytic fission, (3) the nitro-peroxynitrite rearrangement (\ce{O-ONO}), (4) \textgamma-attack of the terminating nitrate oxygen atom and the bridging nitrate oxygen at their relative \textgamma-carbon sites, (5) the homolytic \ce{C-O} bond cleavage, (6) and (7) two variations of the homolytic \ce{C-C} bond cleavage. 
%
It was found that the two most significant decomposition reactions were homolysis of the nitrate ester \ce{O-NO2} bond (equation \ref{equ:homofiss}) and intramolecular elimination of \ce{HNO2} (equation \ref{equ:hno2_elim}). 
%\added{REF}. \added{[This was shown by XXX and XXX \textit{et al.} that whatever whatever process / spectroscopic technique / logic they used to show that this - did I also mentioned this in the intro?  reiterate here: Jacobs, Burke Elrod, ]}
Whilst elimination of \ce{HNO2} was found to be the most energetically favourable denitration pathway, homolytic fission dominated preliminary decomposition steps due to the lower activation barrier and faster rate of reaction. It was suggested that global decomposition processes were determined by the interplay between these two mechanisms. Initial homolysis facilitated wide-spread denitration, complemented by exothermic \ce{HNO2} elimination, promoting self-heating of the system and further bond dissociations. 
The presence of \rad\ce{NO2} and \ce{HNO2} have previously been linked to the autocatalytic rates observed for later-stage decomposition of nitrate esters \cite{Rodger1963,Lindblom2002,Volltrauer1981}, though some studies solely attribute it to the presence of acids \cite{Edge1990,FernandezdelaOssa2011,Baker1952,Binke1999}. %CHECK THESE ARE FACT
Other studies also implicate the action of \rad\ce{NO} and \ce{HNO3}, in addition to \rad\ce{NO2} and \ce{HNO2} \cite{Zayed2012,Trache2018}. 
%avanced stage decomp? Rodger actualy assumes NO2 is confirmed for PETN
% The presence of acid has been linked to autocatalytic rates of degradation during later stages of \ac{NC} degradation\cite{Edge1990,FernandezdelaOssa2011,Baker1952,Binke1999}. 
Inspection of these products generated from initial processes, with observation of the species permeating through to later stages, will shed light on the most likely contributors to  autocatalysis. 
%However, from these initial processes it is not possible to determine which is the species resposible % (this topic is further discussed in the next chapter.) %\ref{chapterlabel6}.) %REF
\subsection{Acid hydrolysis reactions}

Spent acids remain in the \ac{NC} matrix following synthesis, even with thorough washing procedures. %but how much acid? What concentrations? %REF
Additional acidic species are released via the subsequent reactions of \rad\ce{NO2} following homolysis. %, Any residual sulfuric acid from the nitration process catalyses the protonation of \ce{HNO3}, thereby the formation of nitronium (\ce{NO2+}) and hydronium (\ce{H3O}). 
These acids proceed to react with other moieties in the system, such as unsubstituted alcohol side chains on the polysaccharide, or small molecules free in the bulk. 

When exploring the interaction of nitroglycol and nitroglycerin in acid solution, Camera \textit{et al.} \cite{Camera1982} proposed a protonation-denitration scheme (scheme \ref{sch:cameraschema}) whereby initial protonation at the nitrate was rapid (equation \ref{equ:cam_1}), but the subsequent release of the nitronium ion was slow and rate determining (equation \ref{equ:cam_2}).

\ac{NC} in storage is kept wetted with solvents to prevent self-ignition \added{\cite{Rideal1948,Wei2017}}. Material with 12.6\acs{pN} or lower must be stored in 25\% water by mass, or in a controlled mixture of solvents, stabilisers and plasticisers. The material is therefore always exposed to water, with the fast-exchange of protons expected at inter-facial surfaces. % Something about the surfaces exposed to water? Faster NO'2 release or something?
%Fast exchange is expected for groups exposed to water within the bulk, with the dissociation of \ce{NO2+} to generate the alcohol as the rate determining step. %ref back to lit review, about having to store it in water for stability.
%more info on why the second step may be slow / what we expect to see?
In the study of organonitrates and organosulfates %in the acid phase 
generated from isoprene in the aerosol phase, % as secondary organic aerosol, %\ac{SOA}, 
Hu \textit{et al.} found that primary and secondary nitrates were resilient to hydrolysis for pH $>$ 0, whilst tertiary nitrates underwent hydrolytic nucleophilic substitution easily, reacting with water to form alcohols \cite{Hu2011}. %and sulfate to form alcohols and organosulfates
In tertiary nitrates, the carbon is fully substituted with no attached hydrogens. This group is usually sterically hindered and stabilising to carbocations, condition on the electron donation ability of the substituents remaining after nitrate removal. 
If formation of a carbocation intermediate is involved in the hydrolysis mechanism, this may explain why the tertiary nitrates exhibited highly efficient denitration, even under neutral conditions.

Though no specific mechanistic detail is given, the action of a protonated transition state during hydrolysis is alluded to %by Hu \textit{et al.}, 
through the contrast between the rate of acid-catalysed and neutral hydrolysis reactions. Neutral hydrolysis of the tertiary nitrates occured rapidly, but hydrolysis only occurred for primary and secondary nitrates under strongly acid catalysing conditions, and at a much slower rate.   % Adjacent OH groups did not slow down the acid cat hydrolysis of nitrates, but they did for the sulfates. OH groups slowed down hydrolysis for the primary and secondary nitrates.
% in Neutral hydrolysis for tertiary nitrates, more OH meant slowdown in rate of hydrolysis. This primary and secondary nitrates did not experinece this. 
%It was found that t
Additionally, the presence of adjacent OH groups hampered the rate of hydrolysis for some aerosol dispersed organonitrates. In the neutral hydrolysis of tertiary nitrates, increasing the number of adjacent \ce{OH} groups lead to protracted hydrolysis lifetimes.
Interestingly, the retardation effect of adjacent \ce{OH} groups was not observed for the the acid catalysed cases. Hu proposed that this could be due to the interaction of \ce{OH} with the transition state of the neutral hydrolysis system, compared to the protonated transition state of the acid catalysed system, impeding the reaction only in the former case. 
%Pretty weak sentence
The cause of this effect is unclear, and without understanding of the %transition states 
mechanisms involved, it is difficult to explain. % The neutral case happens much faster than the acid case - could it be that by having an OH next door, it is imparting some ''acid-like'' features to the reaction of the neutral process? %Need a bit more explanation here

There is evidence that nitration and denitration of nitrate esters is also influenced by the presence of nitrate groups at neighbouring positions. Matveev \textit{et al.} demonstrated that for poly-nitroesters the rate of liquid-phase decomposition did not increase linearly with number of nitrate reaction centres. It was found to mainly dependend on individual structures (table \ref{tab:reactions}) \cite{Matveev2003}.

%It was suggested that 
The trend in reactivity could be partially explained by the inductive effect of the nitro groups \cite{Oxley2003}. %actually he talks about nitro (NO2), not nitrate...
The inductive effect arises when a difference in the electronegativity between atoms connected by a $\sigma$ bond leads to a polarisation, or permanent dipole, in the bond. Electron donating groups % are of lower electronegativity than  
increase the $\delta^{-}$ partial charge on neighbouring atoms through the release of electrons, whilst electron withdrawing groups pull electron density away, %from neighbouring atoms

The \ce{NO3} presents a stronger electron withdrawing effect than \ce{OH}, which is a donating group. %%The \ce{NO3} presents a stronger electron donating effect via $\pi$ donation than \ce{OH}.

%%OH is actually electron withdrawing for aliphatic alkyles? ``In organic chemistry, an alkyl substituent is an alkane missing one hydrogen.'' %ref? - SO maybe the OH is deactivating here. 
%%It would therefore be expected that both increase the rate of hydrolysis for nearby leaving groups. %(electron donating via \pi donation) 
The presence of an adjacent nitrate appears to facilitate denitration, whereas the presence of hydroxyl groups hinders this process, for neutral hydrolytic schemes. 
The resonance effect, arising from $\pi$ donation by lone pairs on oxygen and nitrogen is negligible %does not come into play 
between substituents at different sites on the polysaccharide ring, as the ring is saturated. 
%This suggests that the proposed interaction of the hydroxyl group with the neutral transition state supersedes its resonance effect. 
%OH - tertiary, neutral hydro: slow down, - primary, secondary, acid cat hydro: no effect
%As a result, it is ambiguous whether any apparent rate increase due to the presence of adjacent nitrate groups arises as a result of the resonance effect of the nitrate, or whether it is solely due to the absence of a neighbouring hydroxyl. 

The investigation by Hu \textit{et al.} exclusively focused on nitrates generated from an isoprene precursor, upon dispersion as an aerosol. The nitrate groups present in \ac{NC} are either of primary (C6) or secondary (C2, C3) structure, indicating that ambient hydrolysis is unlikely according to this scheme. However, solvent effects are expected to differ for condensed-phase reactions and aerosol phases. A greater build-up of acid concentration can be achieved in a closed, condensed system, and the lifetime of an aerosol is relatively short-lived when considering the timescale of slow ageing processes in \ac{NC}. Thus, the work of Hu \textit{et al.} does not provide a direct comparison for the \ac{NC} polymer but highlights the possible contribution from both neutral and acid-catalysed hydrolysis routes, and effect of increasing levels of substitution on the wider structure.%Though ordinarily it would be expected that reactions in aerosol would exhibit a rate increase due to a larger reaction surface, this may skew/increase the rate of specific reactions that do not rely on the diffusion of solvent or other species that move/migrate more slowly through the material. %Where is this even coming from. Some sort of literature proof please. 


In this section, the possible mechanisms for nitrate removal from the \ac{NC} backbone are explored. The homolytic fission and \ce{HNO2} elimination thermolytic processes suggested by Tsyshevsky will be compared to the acid hydrolysis scheme. %The energies of reactions will be compared, with derivation of the reaction rate where it is possible to isolate a transition state. 
Though the relative rates of reaction are not compared, the extended timescales involved in ambient ageing imply that the dominating reactions correspond to those most thermodynamically favourable.

\section{Methodology}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Thermolytic reactions
The energies of homolytic fission (equation \ref{equ:homofiss}) and elimination of \ce{HNO2} (equation \ref{equ:hno2_elim}) were calculated for PETN, as a test system before extension to the \ac{NC} monomer. 
The free energies of reaction ($\Delta$ G) were calculated according to equations \ref{equ:homofiss_calc} and \ref{equ:hno2_elim_calc} to reproduce the work of Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.}, using the published geometries of PETN and its derivatives obtained from the authors (R. Tsyshevsky, personal communication, 19 April 2017).

In the case of the homolysis reaction, only the denitrated radical product geometry was provided. The product of \ce{HNO2} elimination was given as a complex of the \ce{HNO2} leaving group and the newly formed aldehyde. 
A single point energy and frequency calculation were performed on each of the species to determine the reaction energies; no geometry optimisation was performed on the given structures except for in the case the \rad\ce{NO2} molecule, where the geometry was not supplied. A separate \rad\ce{NO2} molecule was independently geometry optimised.

The intramolecular reactions of the \ac{NC} monomer were modelled according to scheme \ref{sch:intra_NC}. % \ref{fig:homofiss_NC} and \ref{fig:elim_NC}.
Rigid and relaxed \ac{PES} scans were attempted for both reactions for the \ac{NC} monomer to obtain an energy profile, and in the case of \ce{HNO2} elimination, identify a transition state. The homolysis reaction was treated as barrierless.  
Where the scans were unable to identify a valid transition state geometry, guess transition state geometries were constructed and optimised.

The possible protonation sites for the \ac{NC} monomer were explored by placing a proton at each of the different oxygen sites surrounding the nitrate group. The structures were then geometry optimised and energies of protonation were compared. \ce{H3O+} was modelled as the donating species; as \ac{NC} is usually stored wetted in water, the hydronium ion is the most likely source of protons (equation \ref{equ:protonation}). %ref precentage water i storage? Pop it in lit review
%Pliego2001 It is well known that
%most esters undergo basic hydrolysis by nucleophilic attack of
%the hydroxide ion onto the carbonyl carbon to yield a
%tetrahedral intermediate, namely the so-called BAC2 mechanism. In rare cases, nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide ion on
%the saturated alkyl carbon leads to the final products in one
%step through an SN2 or BAL2 mechanism
\begin{equation}
\ce{RONO2 + H3O+ -> RONO2H+ + H2O}
\label{equ:protonation}
\end{equation}

It is also possible that the proton is donated by other acidic species in the system, particularly \ce{HNO2} or \ce{HNO3}. This is more likely at later stages of degradation when a higher concentration of acid has been generated by secondary reactions. %REF 
For investigations into the hydrolytic methods of nitrate removal following protonation, or a concerted mechanism involving a proton donor, an ethyl nitrate molecule was used as a truncation of the monomer. This facilitated a speedup of initial \ac{PES} scanning by reducing the degrees of freedom, whilst presenting the moieties necessary for preliminary \ac{TS} searches for the hydrolytic scheme. %CHECK long winded dodgy sentence

In two-dimensional scans, two variables were scanned simultaneously. For the same reaction, the elongation of a the \ce{O-NO2} bond was scanned with simultaneous approach of a proton, to monitor the effect of protonation for the same reaction. %In this case, both the internal angle within  \ce{O-NO2} and the angle was allowed to relax. 
Relaxed scans were performed in Gaussian using the ``modredundant'' function, whereby the whole structure was geometry optimised after each step of the scan. 
Scans were performed with step size of 0.1 $\text{\AA}$. The number of steps varied with the property investigated, though the majority of the phenomena were observed within 20 steps (2 $\text{\AA}$).
Scans were attempted in vacuum, and for the protonation cases, implicit solvent using \ac{PCM} \added{with water ($\epsilon$=78.4) }\cite{Miertus1981}.
%Following each successful scan, a low-level frequency calculation was performed on the obtained transition state. If singular imaginary vibration matching the key bond transformation for the reaction step persisted, then a transition state search was performed using this geometry.
%Where possible, the intermediate “product” geometry obtained from the successful scan was also optimised to B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) for use in transition state searching using QST2 and QST3 methods.

%The protonation studies conducted in solvent were calculated in \ac{PCM} ...% and \ac{SMD} intrinsic solvent models \cite{Marenich2009,Miertus1981}.

\subsection{Thermolytic decomposition mechanisms}
The energies of homolytic fission and intramolecular elimination of \ce{HNO2} from a \ac{PETN} nitrate group are shown in table \ref{tab:intramolec}. The energy values published by Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.} are denoted in parenthesis. As the reaction proceeds with no barrier, the $\Delta G_{r}$ and $E_{a}$ values are the same in the case of homolytic fission.

\acs{PETN} reactant, \acs{TS} and product geometries were supplied by the authors (R. Tsyshevsky, personal communication, 19 April 2017) except in the case of the \rad\ce{NO2} homolysis product, which was not provided. 
The \rad\ce{NO2} leaving group used in the homolysis reaction calculation was independently geometry optimised, with its energy contributing additively to the products of the reaction. \added{The \ac{PETN}\ce{-HNO2} \ac{TS} and product was provided as a complex. }
The same method and basis (\acs{wb97xd}/ 6-31+G(2df,p)) were used in order to recreate the published reaction energies, \added{however, the calculated values fall below the literature values by  0.3 - 1.2 kcal mol$^{-1}$. 
A possible explanation may be that the geometries provided do not exactly match those used in the study, particularly in the case of \rad\ce{NO2}.
A contribution may also arise from variation in calculation setup and the use of a different version and compilation of the \ac{G09} program, leading to fluctuations in the exact values obtained. 
These differences would be amplified %when deriving
when combining individual energies for the calculation of reaction energy values. Cumulatively these changes may explain the discrepancy between the observed values and those in the publsihed study. %Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.}.  
Nevertheless, the calculated value for the activation energy of homolytic fission of \acs{PETN} is comparable to the experimentally derived values of 45.9$\pm$1.2 - 47.3$\pm$0.3 kcal mol$^{-1}$ \cite{Ng1976,Oxley2012,Chambers2002}, and %, measured using \ac{DSC}, and

%Under this assumption, the product species would move apart immediately following fission.

%Scan of the PES
The \ce{O-NO2} bond was incrementally stretched using geometry scanning, to obtain an energy profile of the reaction. 
%The energy profile of the reaction was obtained via %\ac{PES} 
%geometry scans of the \ce{O-NO2} bond elongation, as \ce{NO2} moved away from the \ac{NC} monomer. 
For the rigid scan (figure \ref{fig:homofiss_graph}), only the internal angle of the departing %\rad\ce{NO2}
\ce{NO2} and coordinates referencing its orientation relative to the rest of the molecule were allowed to relax. %Include the details of this calc, which coords allowed to relax, in the appendicies?
As the scan progressed, the \ce{NO2} internal angle increased from 129.2$\degree$ to 134.6$\degree$, at maximum separation of 5 $\text{\AA}$ from the bridging oxygen (Ox). This corresponds to the literature value for the \ce{O-N-O} internal angle (134.3\degree) confirming the formation of a \rad\ce{NO2} radical. %\cite{Trostchansky2010}
%Nevertheless, it is known that the activation energy for bond dissociation is equivalent to the bond enthalpy. 
%SO what?
%This confirms the formation of the radical species via homolytic fission, and that at a separation of 4 $\text{\AA}$ the radical is fully formed and relaxed.

%The values obtained for \ce{HNO2} elimination of PETN follow the results given by Tsyshevsky much more closely. 
%The energies fall within 5 kcal mol$^{-1}$ and 6 kcal mol$^{-1}$ for the Gibbs free energy of reaction and activation barrier, respectively. 
%This is within a reasonable margin of error for comparing with experimentally obtained values, though still larger than expected for those derived using the same method, basis and structure. %DO you have any experimental values for this reaction?

% Nevertheless, it still falls inside the range of experimentally measured PETN degradation activation barriers. %REF and check?
%I think the below actually goes into the methodology
In the case of the \ac{NC} monomer, both rigid and relaxed scans failed to capture the \ac{TS} for cleavage of the nitrate group via interaction with the \textalpha-hydrogen. A guess transition state was constructed based on the \ac{TS} of the analogous reaction for PETN (figure \ref{fig:elim_ts_NC}), and optimised %using opt=TS 
to produce the structure of the correct imaginary vibration. 
The pattern for the \ac{NC} monomer resembles that found for \ac{PETN}; homolysis is endothermic but with lower activation barrier, %put in the numbers
whilst \ce{HNO2} elimination is exothermic, with a much higher barrier. It is anticipated therefore, that the rate of homolytic fission will be faster, whilst \ce{HNO2} loss will happen more slowly, whilst contributing to system heating and increasing acid concentration.

\subsection{Acid hydrolysis mechanism}
\subsubsection{Protonation site}
\label{AH_Protonation}
%Why do we need to look at protonation?
In polar, protic solvents such as water, the fast-exchange of protons between the aqueous medium and  %acceptor groups 
the monomer is expected. %Acid species are also expected to protonate 
Computational studies by Jebber \textit{et al.} and Liu \textit{et al.} probed the protonation behaviour of $\beta$-glucose \cite{Jebber1996,Liu2010}. 
Key findings demonstrated that the most favoured protonation site in glucose was greatly influenced by the conformation of the C6 side branch. For the C6 hydroxymethyl chain orientated in the gauche position, protonation of the ring-oxygen produced the most stable structure.  %; the lowest energy site for protonation whilst the C6 hydroxymethyl chain was in the gauche position, was the oxygen of the C1 hydroxyl group. - doesn't lead to denitration though
%The analogous group in the \ac{NC} monomer, with the C6 nitrate in the gauche position being the lowest energy conformer %see chapt 1
%, is the C1 capping group oxygen.   

The protonated \ac{NC} monomers explored in this section are shown in figure \ref{fig:proton_site}. The bridging oxygen (Ox)% linking the nitrate to the remainder of the molecule
, the C1 capping group oxygen, and the terminal nitrate oxygen sites (Ot) were protonated and their relative energies compared in order to determine the site most likely to stabilise the proton at thermal equilibrium. Protonation also occurs on other sites in the molecule, such as at unsubstituted hydroxyl oxygen sites, the capping group oxygen on C4 and O1 in the glucose ring. Whilst it is possible that protonation at these further sites in the monomer would contribute to degradation, these processes would occur \textit{via} alternative mechanisms without the involvement of denitration. For the purposes of studying acid hydrolysis, only the sites peripheral to the nitrate leaving group were explored. %REf if there is any evidence - peeling off?

\end{figure}
%
%The mechanism of protonation was not explored in depth here; 
%It was assumed that protons in the system would be in fast exchange with the solvent. 
%Any effects of tunneling were included within this assumption. 
The energies for the optimised protonated monomer conformers are listed in table \ref{tab:reactions}. 
There is good agreement between \acs{wb97xd} and \acs{B3LYP} values in the vacuum, with \acs{B3LYP} predicting a \added{slightly} lower reaction energy in all cases. 
\added{This is likely due to the known underestimation of reaction energies by \acs{B3LYP}, particularly in systems involving multiple C-C bonds \cite{Check2005} and with weak, non-covalent interactions \cite{Bachrach2008,Grimme2010}. These issues are treated in \acs{wb97xd} with the inclusion of medium and long term dispersion, and has been shown to improve the accuracy of modelled C-C bond lengths \cite{Fokin2012}, in particular outperforming \acs{B3LYP} in calculations involving hydrogen bonding networks \cite{Bachrach2013}. } % WHY % and solvent, with \ac{B3LYP} . 
The large difference in the reaction energies between the gaseous and implicit solvent values are explained by the instability of \ce{H3O+} in vacuum, where it prefers to lose the proton and exist as water. Ionic species exhibit much greater reactivity in the gaseous phase compared with their neutral counterparts \cite{Pliego2001,Pliego2002,Chandrasekhar1985}. 
When in solution, the positive charge is solvent stabilised% and the reactivity of the  \ce{H3O+}ion is attenuated by the solvent
; the proton is less readily released. %OR rather, a solvent shell will form around it, allowing the charge to be stabilised by the polar water molecules. Proton exchange will occur, but essentially it is more stable. Reaction with anothes molecule requires disruption of the solvent shell. Overall more stabilised and less easy to react.

%

In the gaseous phase, the most thermodynamically favoured protonation sites are at the terminal (syn) and capping positions. %The energy of each of the protonated species is identical. 
Inspection of the optimised geometries explains the similarity of their $\Delta G_{r}$ values. The protonated terminal (syn) and capping monomers (figures \ref{fig:tu_vac}) and \ref{fig:cap_vac})) present nearly identical geometries in vacuum. In the terminal (syn) case, the proton has moved towards the capping group oxygen, effectively undergoing a proton transfer and generating the same structure as the protonated capping monomer. 
This is in contrast to the solvent phase (figure \ref{fig:tu_solv})), where the protonated nitrate group is rotated perpendicularly to the ring and the proton remains on the terminal oxygen; the solvent presents stabilisation for the protonated Ot. 
This indicates that the terminal (syn) site is is only likely to remain protonated in solvent, and that protonation at the site in vacuum is highly unstable.
The remainder of the monomers exhibit only minor changes in geometry between vacuum and solvent. Under solvent conditions, the most stable site for protonation is the capping group (which is unlikely to lead to denitration), followed by the bridging oxygen. %explaining the energy difference between the terminal (syn) site protonation and capping group protonation between vacuum and solvent

Water as the protonating species was also attempted (figure \ref{fig:neutral_prot}), by optimisation of one, two and three water molecules in coordination with the nitrate site in the \ac{NC} monomer.  The same was repeated with the hydronium ion to probe likely coordination geometries. However in both cases, no stable complexes could be isolated. It is anticipated that a much larger network of waters around both the regions surrounding the nitrate moiety and the wider molecule, are required to achieve a stable water coordination structure. %ref that 5 water study  I jsut foudn 
This would be of interest for further investigation into the mechanism of neutral hydrolysis involving the autoionsation of water \cite{Silva2013}. %The optimisation of \ce{H3O} in coordination with the fully nitrated monomer was also tested, but was only possible up to the level HF/6-31g.

\subsubsection{Denitration by hydrolysis}
Following the protonation step, possible transition states for the removal of the nitrate were investigated. Direct dissociation of \ce{NO2} from the protonated species was explored (figure \ref{fig:no2-leave})), along with the simultaneous approach of a proton and cleavage of the \ce{NO2}(figure \ref{fig:h-come-no2-leave})). %(figure \ref{fig:scan_coords}). 
The scan of the proton moving towards the bridging site was also conducted, to determine whether any elongation of the \ce{O-NO2} occurred as a result of the formation of the proton-oxygen bond (figure \ref{fig:h-approach})). 
 
%was also completed to gain insight to the energy profile of the process. %any scans to show?

The relaxed \ac{PES} scan of \ce{NO2} removal from ethyl nitrate protonated at the bridging site was used as a preliminary test for the mechanism of denitration, following protonation (figure \ref{fig:PES_EN_scan}). 
Unrestricted \ac{wb97xd} was used in case of the formation of  \rad\ce{NO2} instead of the expected \ce{NO2+}, with 20 steps of 0.1 $\text{\AA}$. However, bond dissociation was not illustrated in the energy profile even when extending the scan distance to a maximum of 6.4 $\text{\AA}$. Instead, a steady increase in the energy was observed. %fig?
It was observed that as the nitro group distance increased, its internal angle increased to 180$\degree$, confirming the formation of \ce{NO2+}. It is anticipated that the departing \ce{NO2+} will further react with water in the system to produce acids conducive to further hydrolysis. 
As the scan proceeded, the molecule rotated and the \ce{NO2+} leaving group aligned with the hydroxyl in an orientation suitable for peroxy group formation (figure \ref{fig:EN_pero}).  %This was the expected outcome for hydrolysis, as 
This mechanism was previously considered in the degradation reactions of \ac{PETN}; %section ref
it was found that the energy of this process was higher than that of \ce{HNO2} elimination, where the nitrate was not initially protonated. The formation of the peroxy bond was not facilitated by the scan parameters due to forced increase of the \ce{O-N} distance. The same process was not observed when the scan was applied to the \ac{NC} monomer. As the formation of the peroxy geometry required re-orientation of the whole molecule, the energy of this rearrangement was not favourable for the bulky \ac{NC} unit. In the real polymeric system, it may induce distortion of the sugar ring, proving even more energetically demanding.  %This was also done n both B3LYP and wb97xd. (MP2 too, but lets leave that)

% Actually, you only allowed internal angles and one orienation one to relax, in the case of the monomer - so the below is bogus - you weren't able to gauge anything from these very restricted scans, because the no2 wasnt' allowed to fully turn to planar. 
%Similar scans were also performed on the \ac{NC} monomer protonated at the bridging site, where the \ce{O-NO2} bond was elongated in order to determine nature of the lost \ce{NO2}. Initially, the whole monomer was held rigid, as only the \ce{O-NO2} was incrimentally increased to produce an energy profile of the bond separation.

It was possible to optimise the 4-membered ring bridging \ac{TS} on the \ac{NC} monomer with frozen \ac{TS} ring geometry \textit{via} preliminary optimisation of the ring structure with methyl nitrate.

% and relaxation of the remaining molecule (figure \ref{fig:4mem_b}). %actually we opt the ring with methyl nitrate first then reattached it to ring
A rigid scan was then performed of the 4-membered ring transition state, starting from the bridging site protonated monomer (figure \ref{fig:all_da_TS}(d)). 
It was revealed that as the nitrate moved away from the system, the proton moved to the capping group site rather than remain on the bridging oxygen as a hydroxyl, %(even when solvated)
as was initially expected. Instead, a ketone group was formed between the bridging oxygen and the ring. At subsequent steps, the ketone group caused the C2 - C3 bond to elongate and break. The scan eventually showed the \ce{NO2} leaving group reclaiming the proton from the capping group oxygen, leading to ring fission. The activation and kinetic barrier involved in ring fission ($\delta$G = 56.9 kcal mol$^{-1}$) is much higher than that of denitration ($\delta$G = 10.1 - 24.8 kcal mol$^{-1}$) \cite{Shukla2012b}; a study on the acid hydrolysis of glucose and xylose demonstrated that ring-opening intermediates were either extremely short lived, or not observed at all \cite{Qian2011}. 
The open-chain product of the scan is likely due to the geometric constraints placed on the geometry of the departing \ce{NO2} group, rather than a likely physical %energetic 
process. However, it sheds light on the scheme by which ring fission may occur under conditions of elevated temperature or pressure, which has been implied in previous work involving the formation of a ketone at earlier stages of the reaction. %REf that oldschool paper with the diagrams

\section{Summary}

%Homolysis is fastest, for the monomer too, with HNO2 coming in second due to slower rate / energetics. (Check if I did anything to actually find this out - may just have to compare energetics.)
\added{In this section, three different denitration reactions were explored as the first stage in ambient decomposition of \ac{NC}. The reactions were firstly tested on \ac{PETN}, where prior studies by Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.} had confirmed homolytic fission and elimination of \ce{HNO2} reactions to be the dominant mechanisms in thermolytic ambient ageing \cite{Tsyshevsky2013}. A singly nitrated monomer was used with methoxy capping groups, to simulate a unit in the \ac{NC} polymer chain. 

Thermolytic cleavage of the nitrate group was modelled \textit{via} homolysis and elimination of \ce{HNO2}. In the case of \ac{PETN} it was found that the reaction energies closely matched those in the published study and in the case of homolysis, fell within range of experimental measurements for enthalpy of reaction and activation energy. }
%were lower than expected when comparing with literature values. For homolytic fission, this may be  %due to treatment of the modelled reaction products as separate molecules instead of a complex, in the case of homolytic fission, or 
%due to the separate evaluation of the \ac{PETRIN} radical and \rad\ce{NO2} energies, where they should have remained in complex following the reaction. %Contributions may also have arisen as a result of differing software compilations. 
The same process was repeated for the \ac{NC} monomer, singly nitrated at the C2 site. The energy of homolytic fission was in good agreement with the expected value based on the outcome of the \ac{PETN} product. 
\ac{PES} scans of homolysis confirmed the loss of \rad\ce{NO2} for %both the case of \ac{PETN} and 
the \ac{NC} monomer. % \added{It is therefore expected that both reactions will occur in the system, with environmental }

The elimination of \ce{HNO2} \textit{via} intramolecular \textalpha-H transfer was compared with homolysis. The calculated energies of reaction and activation energy values gave good agreement with the published values in the case of \ac{PETN} \cite{Tsyshevsky2013}. 
Calculated \ac{NC} values were also within the anticipated range, based on the reaction for \ac{PETN}. \ac{PES} scans were unable to locate a \acs{TS} for the \ac{NC} monomer, however, a successful guess geometry was generated based on the analogous \acs{TS} structure in the reaction for \ac{PETN}. %In general, the energies of activation are higher for \ac{NC} than for \ac{PETN}, though this is reasonable, and neighbouring \ce{-ONO2} groups are said to destabilise ...
Enthalpies of reaction showed that this process was more exothermic in the case of \ac{NC} than for \ac{PETN}, and that the elimination of \ce{HNO2} was more thermodynamically favourable in \ac{NC} compared to homolysis. However, homolysis may occur more rapidly, as is the case for \ac{PETN}. 

%Scans did confirm that \rad\ce{NO2} left as a radical.
%Scans showed the energy profiles involved (again, was HNO2 ever seen to be formed? )
The protonation sites on the \ac{NC} monomer were probed for the most favourable position. It was found that in the gas phase, capping and bridging site protonation lead to the same protonated final structure. 
In the solvent phase, the capping site was energetically preferred seconded by the bridging site. %, though inspection of the optimised geometry showed that it was very close to that of protonation at the capping site. 
Protonation at the capping group site and subsequent reaction would more likely lead to chain scission; this avenue was disregarded in further studies focussing on the acid hydrolysis pathway, in favour of protonation at the bridging oxygen site where the geometry allowed for easy nitrate removal.
 
Optimisation of water - monomer and hydronium - monomer complexes were attempted, in order to obtain information on the nature and orientation of the protonation complex. It was not possible to isolate any stable structures, implying that a larger stabilising network of waters is likely required. 
%summarising lien here on the two diff reactions, and the protonaion results?

Dissociation of \ce{NO2} from the protonated analogues of ethyl nitrate and the \ac{NC} monomer were scanned using a variety of rigid and relaxed \ac{PES} schemes. In the removal of \ce{NO2} from protonated ethyl nitrate, the release of \ce{NO2+} was indicated by the change of geometry around the nitrate from bent to linear, as the \ce{O-NO2} bond elongated. 
Rotation of the remaining ethanol and complexed \ce{NO2+} showed orientation suitable for formation of a peroxide. This rotation was not observed in the case of the monomer, however the leaving group still presented as \ce{NO2+}.
4 and 6 membered ring \ac{TS} were also tested for the denitration reaction. 
%https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=10015 see here for some rings that are supposed to work...
Unexpectedly, it was found that none of the 6-membered ring structures could be isolated, regardless of truncation of the system to a protonated methyl nitrate model, or using the un-protonated monomer to simulate concerted protonation-denitration. 
%prior protonation using methyl nitrate geometries. 
In the case of the bridge-protonated \ac{NC} with formation of the 4-membered ring \ac{TS} at the C2 nitrate, it was possible to relax the \ac{NC} monomer structure around the ring so long as the ring geometry itself was frozen. As the leaving group moved further from the remainder of the molecule, the hydroxyl group located at C2 formed a ketone, losing the proton to the departing \ce{NO2+}, to form \ce{HNO2} in later stages of the scan. Eventually ring fission occurred, as the \ce{HNO2} move sufficient distance away, and the formation of the ketone forced the adjacent \ce{C-C} bond in the ring to stretch, and then break. It is known that the energy required for this process is much higher than that of denitration, so is unlikely to contribute to the initial stages of ambient ageing.
%However, as the energy barrier associated with this are much higher than that of  - dont' expect it, should solely be denitration then peeling off first

\added{In summary, this section explored the degradation reactions responsible for denitration, the primary step leading to more extensive decomposition. With respect to thermolytic mechanisms, it was found that homolysis and \ce{HNO2} elimination were both feasible initial denitration routes. \ce{HNO2} elimination was more energetically favourable and likely to dominate in ambient, purely thermodynamic conditions. Investigation into acid hydrolys pathways found that protonation at the \acs{NC} bridging site was most likely, and whilst a \acs{TS} could not be obtained for the reaction, it was confirmed that hydrolytic denitration occurred with the release of \ce{NO2+}. %limitations?
This work should be extended with further exploration of water complexation around the \acs{NC} monomer through the use of explicit solvent.

In the next chapter the reactions of the species generated as a result of the primary denitration steps will be studied to elucidate the formation pathways of the final experimentally observed degradation products. }
