\section{Introduction}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{chapter5:intro}
The first stage of thermolytic decomposition for nitrate esters is generally agreed to be homolytic fission of the O-N bond linking the nitrate to the alkyl chain, leading to the loss of \ce{^{.}NO2} (equation \ref{equ:homofiss}) \cite{Oxley2003,Foltz2009,Shepodd1997} %many refs
Though nitrate homolysis is an endothermic reaction, the weak O-N bond has a typical dissociation enthalpy of 42 kcal mol\textsuperscript{-1} and is easily cleaved when exposed to elevated temperatures, UV light or impact. %REF UV \cite{Zaki2016}
Whilst the thermolytic degradation of energetic materials has been widely studied experimentally, the ambient, slow ageing mechanisms are less well documented. %REF
Low-temperature decomposition routes are influenced by many factors over a protracted lifetime, and in practical use, materials are usually subject to evolving environmental conditions. %Changes in pressure, humidity, stress and temperature cycles induce changes in the degradation patterns of energetic materials to a varying degree. %ref?
External changes in pressure, humidity, stress and temperature cycles induce variation in the degradation patterns of energetic materials. %ref?
The presence of moisture has been observed to lower the activation energy and accelerate the decomposition of energetic materials \cite{Foltz2009}.  %PETN
Internal factors including impurities and residual solvent, and crystal growth within the bulk, also alter decomposition behaviour.

The decomposition of nitrate esters at temperatures over 100\degree C is dominated by thermolytic processes, whilst under 100\degree C, decomposition is thought to largely be the result of hydrolysis \cite{Moniruzzaman2014}. 
Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.} studied the intramolecular reactions leading to denitration in \ac{PETN} in both the vacuum and the bulk crystal \cite{Tsyshevsky2013} (figure \ref{fig:PETN_react}). %diagram

It was found that the two dominating decomposition reactions were homolysis (equation \ref{equ:homofiss}) and intramolecular elimination of \ce{HNO2} (equation \ref{equ:hno2_elim}).
%
Whilst elimination of \ce{HNO2} was found to be the most energetically favourable denitration pathway, homolytic fission dominated preliminary decomposition steps due to the lower activation barrier and faster rate of reaction. It was suggested that global decomposition processes were determined by the interplay between the two mechanisms. Initial homolysis facilitated wide-spread denitration, complemented by exothermic \ce{HNO2} elimination promoting self-heating of the system and further bond dissociations. 
The presence of \ce{^{.}NO2} and \ce{HNO2} were previously linked to autocatalytic rates observed for later-stage decomposition of nitrate esters \cite{Rodger1963,Lindblom2002,Volltrauer1981,Rodger1964}, though some studies solely attribute it to the presence of acids \cite{Edge1990,FernandezdelaOssa2011,Baker1952,Binke1999}. %CHECK THIS FACT
%avanced stage decomp? Rodger actualy assumes NO2 is confirmed for PETN
% The presence of acid has been linked to autocatalytic rates of degradation during later stages of \ac{NC} degradation\cite{Edge1990,FernandezdelaOssa2011,Baker1952,Binke1999}. 
 However, from these initial processes it is not possible to determine which is the species resposible % (this topic is further discussed in the next chapter.) %\ref{chapterlabel6}.)

Spent acids remain in the \ac{NC} matrix following synthesis even with thorough washing procedures. %but how much acid? What concentrations? %REF
Acids are further generated via the subsequent reactions of \ce{^{.}NO2} following homolysis. %, Any residual sulfuric acid from the nitration process catalyses the protonation of \ce{HNO3}, thereby the formation of nitronium (\ce{NO2+}) and hydronium (\ce{H3O}). 
The acidic species proceed to react with other moieties in the system, such as unsubstituted alcohol side chains on the polysaccharide, or other small molecules free in the bulk. 

When exploring the interaction of nitroglycol and nitroglycerin in acid solution, Camera proposed a protonation-denitration scheme whereby initial protonation at the nitrate is rapid, but subsequent release of the nitronium ion was slow (scheme \ref{sch:cameraschema}).

\ac{NC} in storage is kept wetted with solvents to prevent drying and self-ignition. Material with 12.6\acs{pN} or lower, must be stored in 25\% water by mass, or a mixture of solvents and plasticisers. % Something about the surfaces exposed to water? Faster NO'2 release or something?
%Fast exchange is expected for groups exposed to water within the bulk, with the dissociation of \ce{NO2+} to generate the alcohol as the rate determining step. %ref back to lit review, about having to store it in water for stability.
In the study of organonitrates and organosulfates generated from isoprene as secondary organic aerosols, %\ac{SOA}, 
Hu \textit{et al.} found that primary and secondary nitrates were resilient to hydrolysis for pH $>$ 0, whilst tertiary nitrates underwent hydrolytic nucleophilic substitution easily, reacting with water to form alcohols \cite{Hu2011}. %and sulfate to form alcohols and organosulfates

\end{scheme}
Primary nitrates are those with one non-hydrogen moiety on the carbon, (additional to the nitrate linkage) with the remaining two bonds linked to hydrogens. Secondary nitrates are those where the nitrate carbon posses one bonded hydrogen atom, and two further non-hydrogen moieties. In tertiary nitrates, the carbon is fully substituted with no attached hydrogens. This latter group is usually sterically hindered and stabilising to carbocations, condition on the other substituents. 
If formation of a carbocation intermediate is involved in the hydrolysis mechanism, this may explain why the tertiary nitrates exhibited highly efficient denitration, even under neutral conditions.

Though no specific mechanistic detail is given, the action of a protonated transition state during hydrolysis is alluded to by Hu \textit{et al.}, through the contrast between the rate of acid-catalysed and neutral hydrolysis reactions. Neutral hydrolysis of the tertiary nitrates occured rapidly, but hydrolysis only occurred for primary and secondary nitrates under strongly acid catalysing conditions at much lower rate.   % Adjacent OH groups did not slow down the acid cat hydrolysis of nitrates, but they did for the sulfates. OH groups slowed down hydrolysis for the primary and secondary nitrates.
% in Neutral hydrolysis for tertiary nitrates, more OH meant slowdown in rate of hydrolysis. This primary and secondary nitrates did not experinece this. 
It was found that the presence of adjacent OH groups hampered the rate of hydrolyis for some aerosol dispersed organonitrates. In the neutral hydrolysis of tertiary nitrates, increasing the number of adjacent \ce{OH} groups lead to protracted hydrolysis lifetimes.
Interestingly, the retardation effect of adjacent \ce{OH} groups was not observed for the the acid catalysed cases. Hu proposed that this could be due to the interaction of \ce{OH} with the transition state of the neutral hydrolysis system, compared to the protonated transition state of the acid catalysed system, impeding the reaction only in the former case. % The neutral case happens much faster than the acid case - could it be that by having an OH next door, it is imparting some ''acid-like'' features to the reaction of the neutral process?
There is evidence that nitration and denitration of nitrate esters is also influenced by the presence of nitrate groups at neighbouring positions. Matveev \textit{et al.} demonstrated that for poly-nitroesters the rate of liquid-phase decomposition did not increase linearly with number of nitrate reaction centres. It was found to mainly dependend on individual structures (table \ref{tab:reactions}) \cite{Matveev2003}.

It was suggested that the trend in reactivity could be partially explained by the inductive effect of the nitro groups \cite{Oxley2003}. %actually he talks about nitro (NO2), not nitrate...
The inductive effect arises when a difference in the electronegativity between atoms connected by a $\sigma$ bond leads to a polarisation, or permanent dipole, in the bond. Electron donating groups % are of lower electronegativity than  
increase the $\delta$- partial charge on neighbouring atoms through the release of electrons, whilst electron withdrawing groups pull electron density away from neighbouring atoms generating a $\delta$+ charge on connected atoms. However, the $\pi$ donation by lone pairs on the oxygen and nitrogen plays a significant role in increasing electron density of neighbouring atoms, known as the resonance effect. 
%Nitrate ester moieties
\ce{NO3} presents a stronger electron donating effect via $\pi$ donation than \ce{OH}. %, though both groups are activating.  OH is actually electron withdrawing for aliphaic alkyles?
It would therefore be expected that both increase the rate of hydrolysis for nearby leaving groups.  %(electron donating via \pi donation) 
The presence of an adjacent nitrate appears to facilitate denitration, whereas the presence of hydroxyl groups hinders this process, for neutral hydrolytic schemes. 
This suggests that the proposed interaction of the hydroxyl group with the neutral transition state supersedes its resonance effect. 
%OH - tertiary, neutral hydro: slow down, - primary, secondary, acid cat hydro: no effect
As a result, it is ambiguous whether any apparent rate increase due to the presence of adjacent nitrate groups arises as a result of the resonance effect of the nitrate, or whether it is solely due to the absence of a neighbouring hydroxyl. 

The investigation by Hu \textit{et al.} exclusively focused on nitrates generated from an isoprene precursor, upon dispersion as an aerosol. The nitrate groups present in \ac{NC} are either of primary (C6) or secondary (C2, C3) structure, indicating that ambient hydrolysis is unlikely according to this scheme. However, solvent effects are expected to differ for condensed-phase reactions and aerosol phases. A greater build-up of acid concentration can be achieved in a closed, condensed system, and the lifetime of an aerosol is relatively short-lived when considering the timescale of slow ageing processes in \ac{NC}. Thus, the work of Hu \textit{et al.} does not provide a direct comparison for the \ac{NC} polymer but highlights the the possible contribution from both neutral and acid-catalysed hydrolysis routes and of increasing levels of substitution on the wider structure.%Though ordinarily it would be expected that reactions in aerosol would exhibit a rate increase due to a larger reaction surface, this may skew/increase the rate of specific reactions that do not rely on the diffusion of solvent or other species that move/migrate more slowly through the material. %Where is this even coming from. Some sort of literature proof please. 

In this section, the possible mechanisms for nitrate removal from the \ac{NC} backbone are explored. The homolytic fission and \ce{HNO2} elimination thermolytic processes suggested by Tsyshevsky will be compared to the acid hydrolysis scheme. %The energies of reactions will be compared, with derivation of the reaction rate where it is possible to isolate a transition state. 
Though the relative rates of reaction were not compared, the extended timescales involved in ambient ageing imply that the dominating reactions correspond to those most thermodynamically favourable.

\section{Methodology}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Thermolytic reactions
The energies of homolytic fission and elimination of \ce{HNO2} were calculated for PETN, as a test system before extension to the monomer. The reaction energies were calculated according to equations \ref{equ:homofiss} and \ref{equ:hno2_elim} to reproduce the work of Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.}.  The literature geometries of PETN and its derivatives were obtained from the authors. A single point energy and frequency calculation were performed on each of the relevant structures to determine the reaction energies; no geometry optimisation was performed on the given structures except for in the case the \ce{^{.}NO2} molecule, where the geometry was not given.

The intramolecular reactions of the \ac{NC} monomer were modelled according to scheme \ref{sch:intra_NC}. % \ref{fig:homofiss_NC} and \ref{fig:elim_NC}.

Rigid and relaxed \ac{PES} scans were attempted in order to locate transition states for both reactions for the \ac{NC} monomer. 
Where the scans were unable to identify a valid transition state geometry, guess transition state geometries were constructed and optimised. 

The possible protonation sites for the \ac{NC} monomer were explored by placing a proton at each of the different oxygen sites surrounding the nitrate group. The structures were then geometry optimised and energies of protonation were compared. \ce{H3O+} was modelled as the donating species; as \ac{NC} is usually stored wetted in water, the hydronium ion is the most likely source of protons. %ref precentage water i storage? Pop it in lit review
It is also possible that the proton is donated by other acidic species in the system, particularly \ce{HNO2} or \ce{HNO3}. This is more likely at later stages of degradation when a higher concentration of acid has been generated by secondary reactions.%REF

\subsection{Computational details} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All geometry optimisation, thermochemistry calculations and \ac{PES} scans were performed in \ac{G09}. 
Geometry optimisation and thermal calculations were to the level of 6-31+G(2df,p). \ac{NC} monomer structures were optimised using \ac{wb97xd}, \ac{B3LYP} and \ac{MP2}. 
$\Delta G$ values were obtained by the difference between the thermally corrected free energies of products and reactants. 
Zero-point corrected energies \acs{ZPE} were determined by addition of individual \ac{ZPE} to the free energy:
\begin{equation}
\centering
\Delta G^{ZPE} = \sum(G_{products}+ZPE_{products}) - \sum(G_{reactants}+ZPE_{reactants})
\label{equ:ZPE}
\end{equation}
%IRC step ,maxpoints=256,maxcycle=256 , stepsize the default of  0.1 Bohr
\ac{PES} scans were performed to the level of \ac{wb97xd}/6-31+g(d), or using unrestricted \ac{wb97xd}, in the case of \ce{O-^{.}NO2} dissociation. 
Rigid scans were carried out by fixing bond lengths, angles and dihedral values as constants. Only the variable of interest was allowed to change, with the exception of  relaxation of other specified coordinates required for accommodation of the new geometry, following each step of the scan.  %(semi-rigid scans). 
For example, in the homolysis of the nitrate \ce{O-NO2} bond, as the \ce{NO2} group departed, the internal \ce{O\textendash N\textendash O} angle was also allowed to relax, in addition to the angle of the departing \ce{NO2} with respect to the remainder of the molecule.
In two-dimensional scans, two variables are scanned. For the same reaction, the elongation of a the \ce{O-NO2} bond was scanned with simultaneous approach of a proton, to monitor the effect of protonation for the same reaction. %In this case, both the internal angle within  \ce{O-NO2} and the angle was allowed to relax. 
Relaxed scans were performed in Gaussian using the \''modredundant\'' function, whereby the whole structure was geometry optimised after each step of the scan. 
Scans were performed with step size of 0.1 \AA. The number of steps varied with the property investigated, though the majority of the phenomena were observed within 20 steps (2 \AA).
Scans were attempted in vacuum, and for some cases, \ac{PCM} implicit solvent \cite{Miertus1981}.
%Following each successful scan, a low-level frequency calculation was performed on the obtained transition state. If singular imaginary vibration matching the key bond transformation for the reaction step persisted, then a transition state search was performed using this geometry.
%Where possible, the intermediate “product” geometry obtained from the successful scan was also optimised to B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) for use in transition state searching using QST2 and QST3 methods.

%The protonation studies conducted in solvent were calculated in \ac{PCM} ...% and \ac{SMD} intrinsic solvent models \cite{Marenich2009,Miertus1981}. 

\section{Results and discussion}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Thermolytic decomposition mechanisms}
The energies of homolytic fission and intramolecular elimination of \ce{HNO2} from a \ac{PETN} nitrate group %, calculated from a single point energy and frequency calculation on the supplied geomety,
 are shown in table \ref{tab:intramolec}. The energy values calculated by Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.} are denoted in parenthesis.
Despite using the supplied geometries, same method and basis, it can be seen that the reaction energies obtained for PETN vary greatly from the values found by Tsyshevsky \textit{et al.}. 
 %The structures of PETN, the transition states and products were used directly as supplied by the authors, however, 
Inspection of the forces showed that they were in fact not converged. It was expected that the given geometries were used to generate the reaction energy values quoted in the study. The unconverged structures therefore do not fully explain the large discrepancy between the literature energies and obtained values here.
% , though a possible explanation may be that different geometries were used for the values presented in the study.  (maybe this is too obvious to say)
A small contribution may arise from a different compilation of the \ac{G09} program, leading to fluctuations in the exact values obtained which are amplified when deriving reaction energies. 
 %Additional explanations may be that %and the obvious suggestion that perhaps alternative geometries were used ,....  in addition to a different compilation of Gaussian
%Despite the difference in the calculated $E_{a}$ values, both fall into the range of PETN experimental activation energies for decomposition. Actually no, mine is too low.

The energy profile of homlytic fission was obtained via \ac{PES} scans of \ce{NO2} leaving the \ac{NC} monomer. The internal angle of the departing \ce{NO2}, in addition to the coordinates referencing its orientation relative to the rest of the molecule, was allowed to relax. As the scan progressed the \ce{NO2} internal angle increased from 129.2 \degree to 134.0 \degree at a maximum separation of 3.4 \AA from the bridging oxygen (Ox), corresponding to the formation of a \ce{^{.}NO2} radical (internal angle 134.3 \degree).
%Nevertheless, it is known that the activation energy for bond dissociation is equivalent to the bond enthalpy. 

\subsection{Acid hydrolysis mechanism}
\subsubsection{Protonation site}
The protonated \ac{NC} monomer species are shown in figure \ref{fig:proton_site}. The bridging oxygen (Ox) linking the nitrate to the remainder of the molecule, the capping group oxygen, and the interchangeable terminal nitrate oxygen sites were protonated in order to compare their relative energies for determination the site most likely to stabilise the proton at thermal equilibrium. Protonation also occurs on other sites in the molecule, such as at unsubstituted hydroxyl groups, the capping group oxygen on C4 and O1 in the glucose ring. Though is a possibility that protonation at further sites in the monomer would contribute to degradation processes \textit{via} alternative mechanisms, for the purposes of studying denitration via acid hydrolysis, only the sites peripheral to the nitrate leaving group were explored. %REf if there is any evidence - peeling off?

The mechanism of protonation was not explored in depth here; it was assumed that the protons in the system would be in fast exchange between the molecule and the solvent. The process has been studied computationally by Jebber \textit{et al.} and Liu \textit{et al.} \cite{Jebber1996,Liu2010}. 
The optimisation of water as a protonating species was attempted, to see whether it was possible to stabilise in coordination.  The optimisation of H3O in coord with fully nitrated monomer was also tested, but was only possible up to the level hf/6-31g.

\subsection{Denitration by hydrolysis}
Following the protonation step, possible transition states for the removal of the nitrate were investigated. 
A \ac{PES} scan was performed on the \ac{NC} monomer protonated at the bridging site, where the \ce{O-NO2} bond was elongated in order to determine whether the \ce{NO2} is lost, leaving the hydroxyl group as expected. 
% leaving group is lost as \ce{NO2}, and the nature of the monomer following denitration. 
%probe the generated denitration products.
% to simulate the removal of \ce{NO2}. 
Unrestricted \ac{wb97xd} was used, with 20 steps of 0.1 \AA, however bond dissociation was not observed even when extending the scan distance to a maximum of 6.4 \AA. Instead, a steady increase in the energy was observed. 
%This may be due to the specification of the spin  /charge?

The \ac{PES} scan of \ce{NO2} removal from ethyl nitrate protonated at the bridging site was used as a preliminary test for the mechanism of denitration following protonation.

4-membered ring and 6-membered ring structures were optimised in order to determine whether they were energetically and geometrically feasible. It can be seen that as the nitrate departs, it aligns with the hydroxyl group in an orientation suitable for formation of a peroxy group.

Optimisations were attempted with both full geometry relaxation, and various frozen co-ordiate schemes; fixing of the bulk molecule with relaxation only around the nitrate and co-ordinating species or relaxation of the wider molecule with fixed coordinates around the nitrate. 
Fully relaxed structures did not show convergence.
It was possible to optimise the 4-membered ring bridging transition state with frozen ring geometry and relaxation of the remaining molecule (figure \ref{fig:4mem_b}). %actually we opt the ring with methyl nitrate first then reattached it to ring
A rigid scan of the 4-membered ring transition starting from the bridging protonation site revealed that as the nitrate moved away from the system, the proton moved to the capping group site rather than remain on the bridging oxygen as a hydroxyl, as was expected. Instead a ketone group was formed between the bridging oxygen and the ring. At subsequent steps, the ketone group causes the C2 - C3 bond to elongate and break. The scan eventually revealed the \ce{NO2} leaving group reclaiming the proton from the capping group oxygen, leading to ring fission.

\section{Summary}
Homolysis is fastest, for the monomer too, with HNO2 coming in second due to slower rate / energetics. (Check if I did anything to actually find this out - may just have to compare energetics.)
Scans did confirm that \ce{^{.}NO2} left as a radical.
Scans showed the energy profiles involved (again, was HNO2 ever seen to be formed? )

AH rate was not able to be compared as a TS was not found.
Protonation occurs on both terminal and bridging sites of the monomer, with location at the bridging site conducive to the removal of \ce{NO2+}.

TS were not able to be isolated for the denitration step, even with coordination with water in different orientation and both 4 and 6 mem ring TS. 2D scans did reveal a possible TS but it did not lead to the desired denitration pathway.  See water clusters around NC by \cite{Gunko2014}.



%alternate story if given more time to correct geometies - do the scans and TS with the reactified structure, plus the additional of on the interaction with the capping site.
